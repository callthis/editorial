## 2.1.1 Carizon

Specifically within the context of *[The File,](https://github.com/true-hindsight/grim-realities/blob/main/navigating-this-gitrepo.md#20-navigating-this-documentation)* I would like to point out the activities of ***Carizon,*** which as an organization, eventually managed to show some concern for a person like me who was illegitimately arrested, and then physically violated as well as abused by grievous actions of various coordinated agents from Canadian public service units. Coincidentally, those public service units, and the places where the abuses took place, happened to be within the immediate vicinity of Carizon in Kitchener, Ontario. 

Members of Carizon demonstrated sincerity, sympathy, and contrition about their errors in an online meeting with me (during August 2022). They also spoke about the beginnings of a plan of action towards better outcomes for their current and future clients, based on the portion of evidence given to them that they were able to consider and accept. I therefore commend them because the cognitive dissonance that can arise against any allegations about misconduct, incompetence, or impropriety at an individual and organizational level of human psychology, can make it considerably difficult for the organization's members, and leaders, to admit to playing any role in contributing towards any types of harms or injuries, as expressed in the data shown to them. The magnitude of cognitive dissonance, fundamental attribution errors, or selective biases against admitting to having made any contributions to high crimes and misdemeanors can become particularly impenetrable, for this category of professionals. This is especially true when professionals in this category of workers are nudged by a mere dyslexic patchwork of written or scanned pieces of evidence, or by merely vocalized concerns during counseling sessions, that were brought forth by a person who had sought psychological support from such healthcare professionals.

However, I am still dismayed and disappointed by the fact that Carizon's leadership and concerned officers, downplayed the evidence of ongoing serial murders, and debilitating actions committed by Canadian public service units against systematically profiled targets. Actions of those public service units along with their private partners that have continued to intentionally, and forcefully inflict visceral and pernicious harms upon targeted community members, while using Carizon to assuage and pacify those victims, was downplayed by Carizon as, *"inequitable treatment of community members due to organizational inadequacies among professional agencies."* 

I remain disappointed, doubly so, because those types of murderous harms are still being regularly caused by trained law enforcement, social service, medical, and healthcare practitioners in Ontario, via the unethical use of healthcare and policing resources. Plus, those professionals in Ontario who are still committing intentional harms to vulnerable people, people who are made susceptible via dismissive and misdirecting actions of Carizon, happen to be long-time professional and social peers of Carizon's employees and contractors.

The issue of vulnerable people who are being snared, entrapped, and put to ruinous harms, via the use of fabricated and false pretexts generated by authorized agents of the state, where such state-sponsored agents also cunningly keep trying to cover up any excavated evidence about their culpable actions using overtly sly and dirty deeds, isn't merely termed as, *"inequitable treatment."* These kinds of murderous and ruinous activities of state-sponsored actors are termed as genocidal activities of Canada, because they are being carried out deliberately using systematized methods supplied by members of provincial as well as federal government bodies, against selectively profiled minorities — in Canada.

Now, if one were to claim that the above statements are "an exaggeration," they would first of all be admitting to the fact that there is a serious kernel of truth in these statements and expositions. But, by no means are these truths an exaggeration, if anything, they remain understated because cunning methods of diminishing, suppressing, or even "quashing" such documented evidence are regularly deployed by the state-funded apparatus in countries like Canada, which keep orchestrating genocides at an industrial scale of efficiency.

*Sections 6 through 14 of The File* provide the testimonial details as well as scans of the physical evidence pertaining to the types of murderous abuses persons like me have been, and are being put through on a daily basis, within Canada. An unencrypted version of *The File* was made available to Carizon in early 2022. After that, Carizon's managers took nearly three months to set up an online meeting with me to discuss the role of Carizon's members in not being able to prevent, or curtail, the issues presented to them. According to them, the issues surrounding their decisions and actions, as relating to my specific case-file in their database, mainly had to do with Carizon's members active role in: 
    
- simply never recording provided verbal and even written evidence about — medical abuses done to elderly persons by hospital staff in Oshawa, and harassment of orphans and homeless youth in Kitchener by local police,   
    
- **reflexively** denying validity of presented discussions during counseling sessions by labeling them as dutiable perceptions of a person suffering from stressful circumstances. 
    
>Please see, *Excerpts from Sections 7 & 8 of The File,* regarding abuses and harassment suffered by orphans and homeless youth in Kitchener, due to illegal activities of private real-estate development companies that have been colluding with local police, which is disclosed here - https://github.com/true-hindsight/grim-realities/tree/main/disclosed

Carizon's role in downplaying and sidelining the information given to them about the impacts of the harm being done to refugees, minorities, and newcomers in Ontario, which they must have also come to know during private counseling sessions with numerous other clients who have suffered institutionalized abuses in Kitchener-Waterloo Region, wasn't addressed in the last online meeting they had with me. Carizon's management did not address the issue of why they failed to contact a responsible legal authority to protect persons like homeless youth with observable positive outcomes in favor of those youth, when they could and should have done that, with the knowledge gleaned from the presented evidence. 

Moreover, Carizon took many months to even schedule that eventual online meeting with me in August, 2022, because they cited inability to synchronize the duty-on and duty-off cycles of their concerned managers. This is the kind of unnecessary time-wasting passive-aggressive practices used by culpable agencies, that exacerbate a situation. 

The provincial and federal governments in Canada keep wasting money and time of tax-payers, by deliberately dissuading state-funded agencies like Carizon, from doing what is rightly needed to protect victims and survivors from suffering further harm. By only providing pop-psychology, and bastardized philosophies and practices from Zen Buddhism to suffering individuals, organizations like Carizon only perpetuate the systemic faults that give rise to social distress. The provincial and federal governments of Canada, in turn, take the evidence of social distress as an excuse to increase police brutality against poor and disenfranchised people. Thus, the vicious cycle of poverty and distress continues to ravage places like Kitchener-Waterloo Region. 

Out of dismay and from being worn down by injuries, I only have fleeting hopes that members of agencies like Carizon will learn and become mindful that as soon as they come into contact with any bit of a testimony, or evidence, about a client having suffered cruelty or systematic abuse — in any shape or form — they are to follow through with a necessary set of procedures towards worthwhile justice, for supporting victims and survivors who invariably return to Carizon as clients, with further injuries suffered due to unchecked systemic abuses, if those victims are still alive and able. Thousands of people across Canada, silently die and disappear from public walks of life because of the state's deliberately ineffective assistance in healthcare through organizations like Carizon that "weeds out" people branded by the state as, "at-risk,  poor, diseased, lazy, filth." 

Especially in matters where abusers have been oath-and-duty-bound, local professional service providers like Carizon's members, ought to simply live up to their statutory terms of service, which already mandates them to transmit the <ins>faithfully recorded</ins> testimony or evidence — to a competent authority of the law. Carizon failed to do such required things with any positive effect that could have reduced or prevented the horrors I suffered at the hands of Canadian agents and agencies, during the months that immediately followed my only set of scheduled interactions with Carizon for counseling. 

Actually, Carizon's official terms and conditions of service, till date, only mentions that they are obligated to report to an authority, and potentially share confidential information of their client with officials of law enforcement agencies, in the event of few specific types of incidents involving their client, or in cases of incidents that are expressed as having been witnessed by the client. But Carizon's official terms and conditions of service have never been laid out in a manner to say anything about the quality of any such reports from Carizon, that ought to be provided to local authorities, within a particular time frame. Nor has there been any guidance through those terms and conditions of service about Carizon's members' role in being required to pay any attention to recording things, in verbatim, from a client who has been, or is being subjected to: human rights abuses, or various forms of systematized cruelty and violations by local abusers. 

Additionally, the part that is completely missing from Carizon's terms and conditions of service, is a set of paragraphs that would lay down policies about helping their clients obtain legal advice, and effective directions or guidance from an affordable as well as competent legal practitioner — in order to obtain some legitimate measure of justice — especially in cases wherein evidence of abuses suffered by the client are abundantly available, and the abusers are still within the legal jurisdiction of local authorities. 

**A justice system is not going to magically get pristine evidence from victims via organizations like Carizon whose member's have been trained to reflexively cast doubt on the events retold by victims and survivors.** 

Of course, when the abusers are the very same local authorities, who need the actionable report or filing to be given to them by agencies like Carizon, then a set of policies would also be needed to lay out guidance for approaching a particular trustworthy agency, with higher authority and efficacy, that ought to be contacted on behalf of clients.  

It is truly unfortunate that when I presented Carizon with an opportunity to mitigate their liabilities and culpability owing to the chain of events that constitutes the situation expressed in *The File,* they dismissed it as a note for their suggestion box.

Lastly, as a genuine note of concern for Carizon's suggestion box, please be aware that issues brought to your attention and notice in Canada, are likely to be very similar to the ones faced by aboriginal and immigrant populations in Australia, due to the case-management practices and software tools used by Australian state-sponsored agencies via the information technology suite called *"Penelope."* Coincidentally, the same software tools and case-management practices are being used by agencies like Carizon. 

State-sponsored agencies in Commonwealth Countries keep referencing putative knowledge and tools that have racist and colonial designs. They keep sharing those erroneous resources among themselves as a source of internal and ecological validity, and as a justification for continuing to force various colonial era practices onto the unassuming public. In doing so, "well-meaning" agents and agencies keep copying and amplifying the fundamental faults and errors of bigoted, institutionalized policies and protocols.

So, as an initial act of remedy, you may start by removing the racist ideologies baked into the policies and practices of your colleges, by following the example of the American Psychological Association (APA), towards dismantling racism in sciences: https://www.apa.org/about/apa/addressing-racism
