### University of Waterloo

In November-December, 2022, I provided a short report to the executive members of University of Waterloo (UWaterloo). The report detailed ways in which international students were being harmed and cheated by the UWaterloo's "Master's of Business Entrepreneurship and Technology" (MBET) program. It also explained the way Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada had played an active role in allowing UWaterloo's MBET to snare international students from around the world, and then sneakily deprive targeted students from obtaining a proper Work Permit, and Temporary Resident Visa, upon completion of their MBET program. The details of the ongoing, multi-decade long, international-scale scam perpetrated via UWaterloo's Conrad School of Business and Entrepreneurship (which used to be called Conrad Center for Business, Entrepreneurship and Technology) are provided in the next section. 

In this section, I'd like to first discuss UWaterloo's official response and actions taken, during the months of November-2022 through March-2023. My polite and candid emails to UWaterloo's leadership and management only got denials in the form of responses. Those set of emails are saved online in another repository, for the sake of posterity - https://github.com/true-hindsight/grim-realities/tree/main/emails  

It is entirely evident that UWaterloo's management and leadership were simply uncaring. They were a complete let-down, and have remained unconscionably irresponsible, in taking appropriate action to protect and serve the best interests of harmed students and alumni. Their priority has instead been to deny and deflect all evidence that proves the illegitimate, inauthentic, and harmful nature of UWaterloo's MBET program. The MBET program's instructors and managers were similarly callous, however their arrogance and callous behavior in this regard, is much more deliberate than the shamelessly uncaring attitude of UWaterloo's authority figures.
