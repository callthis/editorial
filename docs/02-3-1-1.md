### 2.3.1.1 The Nexus Between IRCC and UWaterloo 

For Canada to be able to acquire immigrants who possess higher education and skills, the incentives it needs to present to potential newcomers, have to compete with "the dream" sold by America, UK, Euro Zone, and other such regions of the world, where the local economy cannot survive without immigrants taking up jobs that involve dull-dirty-dangerous conditions. Acquiring labor forces via immigration is a necessary requirement for such industrialized regions of the world to maintain or add, actual (real) value to the region's economy. Such countries wouldn't merely stagnate, or go into a recession due to a lack of skilled and unskilled workers obtained through yearly immigration, they would, in all likelihood, experience a phenomenon called colony collapse, without the constant influx of migrants, and of international prisoners of war labeled as "refugees." 

Immigrants, refugees, abducted children, and prisoners obtained from wars who are labeled as asylum seekers, become an easily exploitable source of cheap labor. Such labor forces are indentured to the municipality, estate, or production plant they end up in, due to their desperate and hapless circumstances. Taking undue advantage of the weak and huddled masses, has been the cornerstone of colonial era economics, as well as of the current, mechanization and automation dependent "information age."   

The promise made by an institution like UWaterloo to potential students and visiting scholars, through its widely publicized marketing and communications, is of an opportunity for newcomers to avail world-class educational standards, along with the university's state-of-the-art facilities for doing cutting edge research and development work, in fields like nanoscience and quantum computing. Of course, the better opportunities for work, pay, and quality of life are supposedly offered by the more popular, universities and hi-tech companies of the US. So, what could possibly be Canada's edge, in positioning itself as an alternative, and as a better destination, for talented as well as unskilled and semi-skilled labor forces to make their way to Canada, in order to build a better life for themselves and their families, at their new place of residence? And that too, via proper, informed consensual agreements between the state and the migratory residents? 

Arguably, Canada's outlook in the world is that of a humanitarian and egalitarian country. Canada is at least a place where gun-loving-goons, marching with tiki-torches, aren't the ones in-charge of the country. The people in-charge of civic institutions in Canada, are generally viewed by the international community as being more sophisticated, liberal, progressive, conscientious, fair-minded, and well-educated compared to the right-winged nationalists of Italy, Sweden, France, Britain, and other OECD countries. Canada is similarly viewed as a much less racist country on the whole, than various parts of Australia and the US, among international travelers. Moreover, Canada is seldom in the news for mass civilian or military based violence within its cities, or for being a supporter and a sponsor of nefariously orchestrated regime changes in other countries.  

Canada is supposed to be the nice and happy country, with congenial people who are the good guys, right? 

Well, at least on the surface, and in their outwardly appearances, Canadian institutions try to maintain an air of lawful legitimacy while portraying an attitude of peace-loving, polite helpfulness. 

In this section we will look at the systematic methods of cheating and dishonesty used by Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for perilously injuring selectively targeted newcomers in Canada. We will excavate the hidden barriers IRCC has erected in collusion with institutions like UWaterloo, that cunningly deprive targeted newcomers of basic human rights, equity, as well as of appropriate legal statuses for working and living in Canada. 

We will investigate the motivations of IRCC in doing so, in *Section 2.3.2* of this multi-part, editorialized, literary work. 

For now, the reader needs to be aware that the harms and damages caused by IRCC's cunning ways, have indeed inflicted a range of ruinous outcomes upon the lives of targeted victims. This is because the general, specific, and special damages suffered by each international student harmed by wrongful activities of IRCC and Canadian university programs like MBET, also include the ones suffered by victims' familial relationships such as their dependents, as well as their spouse or common law partners.

To understand the treacheries that have been, and continue to be orchestrated by IRCC against newcomers via programs like UWaterloo's MBET, we must first look at some of the existent, statutory rules, regulations, and policies of provincial and federal governments, concerning the higher education based pathway towards immigration, permanent residency, and citizenship in Canada. Then, we will need have a look at the way in which the MBET program's design, along with the activities of UWaterloo's administration in coordination with IRCC, repeatedly and systematically produce grievous impacts on the lives of racially profiled and targeted individuals.

<details><summary><h4>A) IRCC's Rules and Regulations for Work Visas</h4></summary>

1. Canadian provincial and federal governments have ascribed the terminology of ["Designated Learning Institutions" (DLIs)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) to recognized educational centers, schools, colleges, and universities in Canada which have been specially authorized by government bodies, to issue an admission or an invitation letter to prospective students and scholars, for the process of said student or scholar to be able to apply and obtain, an education or training based visit visa, so that they may then legally enter into Canada for educational purposes. The appropriate visit visa obtained for an authentic and legitimate educational program, is therefore, a vital necessity for a person to be able to pursue the Canadian educational program they have been accepted into.

1. For this ~~dissection~~ discussion, we will focus on the work related visa a person can obtain, via the successful completion of a graduate study program's coursework at a Canadian DLI. 

    1. Canadian immigration policies and statutes clearly state that once a person has graduated from a regular graduate study program offered by a DLI, the person can avail the opportunity to apply for a Post Graduate Work Permit (PGWP) with its associated Temporary Resident Visa (TRV), as a "work visa", in order to legally reside and work in Canada. 

    1. As per IRCC's published polices, the duration of a PGWP and TRV, that can be given by its application processing office to a successful applicant, depends on the duration of the graduate study program's coursework attended, and completed, by the applicant. 

    1. Let us consider the following two questions: "Has the IRCC been genuine, forthright, and transparent about its policy to provide a one year long PGWP with its associated TRV, for successful applicants who complete a graduate study program from a Canadian DLI, with a course duration of one year? And similarly, has the IRCC been honest and transparent about providing an option of a three year long PGWP with its associated TRV, for successful applicants who complete a graduate study program from a Canadian DLI, with a course duration that is two or more years in length?"

    1. The answer to both of the above objective questions is an affirmative yes! This is because of the following verifiable public information that was published by IRCC, and has continued to be on display in its official `canada.ca` web-pages, and in legal effect, since the time of adopting the concept of DLIs.

    1. The following two pieces of evidence referencing Canadian statutes prove that when it comes to the period of validity of a PGWP, "The permit won’t be longer than the length of your study program" (as quoted in the given reference).

<details><summary><h4>B) Responsibilities of UWaterloo and MBET</h4></summary>

1. MBET has continued to be a graduate study program offered by UWaterloo, *with a coursework duration of only one year*, from the time of its inception in early 2000s. Every prospective MBET student knows that the program's duration is of a single year, and aims to complete or extend their legal residence requirements in Canada, by the end of their MBET coursework. 

1. Similar to the essential documents issued by a DLI to a student or a scholar, for their entry into Canada and also for their admission into a particular program offered by the DLI, a number of official and vital documents are issued by the DLI at the time of course completion. This is so that the graduate may apply for further studies, or authorized work, and continue to reside legally within Canada. 

1. The **"Official Transcript"** pertaining to the graduated student's coursework, and **"The Letter of Course Completion"** are the essential, and main pieces of proof that indicate the student's graduation from the DLI upon the successful completion of their coursework. These two official documents issued by the DLI, are a necessary part of the application package that needs to be submitted by the applicant to IRCC, for a PGWP and its associated TRV. They are necessarily used by IRCC officers, to make a decision on providing a PGWP and TRV to an applicant, with a particular duration of the permit's validity.

1. The Letter of Course Completion is also referred to as, "Letter confirming completion of the program of study", in various IRCC documentation for PGWP.  

</details>


<details><summary><h4>C) Ongoing Systematic Discrimination Orchestrated by IRCC in Coordination with UWaterloo</h4></summary>

1. The Official Transcript issued by UWaterloo shows the grades obtained by the student in each semester. UWaterloo usually has three semesters per year, which can at times be different for particular courses offered by some of UWaterloo's Colleges. So, by doing quite a bit of calculation about the number of semesters per year, the Official Transcript could, perhaps, indicate to a carefully inspecting IRCC officer, that the MBET program's is of one year duration.   

1. As such, the Letter of Course Completion has a standard template of text, which clearly describes that the graduate student attended and completed, a particular full-time coursework of a stated duration of certain months or years, at the issuing DLI.

1. However, the verbiage of The Letter of Course Completion issued by UWaterloo via the MBET program's supervisors, is deliberately vague and omits the duration of the MBET coursework in months (or years).

1. UWaterloo has continued to often mislead, and misdirect persons reading The Letter of Course Completion, by simply deleting the portion of the verbiage in the letter, about the number of months or years of full-time coursework completed by the graduated MBET student. UWaterloo has thus lied by omission, year-after-year, on most of the official Letters of Course Completion it provides to international students for being considered by IRCC application processing offices. The strange thing is that on some of the official letters indicating the completion of the MBET coursework, its duration is clearly mentioned as one year. 

1. It is also possible that the actual duration of the MBET coursework is less than ten months, with two-to-three months of the program being labeled as "practicum", during which the students are free to work on any startup related idea of their choice, on their own, in an unsupervised manner, without having to attend any classes. The students are of course able to consult with MBET instructors and professors, during the period of their practicum. 

1. Now, for the IRCC to provide a three year long PGWP along with its TRV, to any graduate student, based on a one year (or less) duration of coursework completed by the student at a Canadian DLI, would be a clear violation of Canada's immigration statutes and policies, wouldn't it? Well, that is precisely what has been ongoing for more than 20 consecutive years, at least in the case of UWaterloo-MBET. However, if you think, "it depends" is somehow the more appropriate answer to the previous question, then please continue to read the remaining paragraphs. 

1. The ongoing problems discussed here, have persisted for more than the past two decades, where upon inspection, one is able to identify that mainly MBET students from the Middle-East and Africa were denied a three year long work visa, while other international student graduates of MBET were given a three year long PGWP along with its TRV, for doing nothing different in their application process compared to the ones from the Middle-East and Africa. This implies that a systematic and selective form of discrimination has been enforced by IRCC, against those students who were not treated on par with all other MBET students, in a deceitful and surreptitious manner. 

1. Pretending that the IRCC has a right to secretively exercise "discretionary powers" to provide a three year long PGWP and a TRV, to international students graduating from a one year long program, is utterly wrongful. IRCC officers are duty-bound to abide by their word of honor, and by their transparently stated statutes. The IRCC does not have any right to discriminate, or act whimsically, when making serious decisions that can drastically impact the lives of people it is meant to serve honestly, and dutifully. 

1. The negative, discriminatory bias harbored by IRCC officers against students from a Muslim background, can only be termed as Islamophobia. In this manner, the disservice and treachery IRCC has continued to commit, against selectively targeted individuals, is disgraceful to the entirety of Canada, and surreptitiously hurtful to all members of the international community.  

1. Have international students from other programs similar to the MBET, offered by other Canadian DLIs, had a similar or a different experience with IRCC while applying for a PGWP? 

1. How many more DLIs throughout Canada have used ambiguously worded official documents, to mislead IRCC application processing officers? 

1. Is there any means to believe that IRCC's higher-ups, were completely unaware of the ongoing discrimination against particular international students which also happens to violate Canada's published statutes? 

1. Is one supposed to truly believe that for more than two decades, IRCC officials never once questioned why they tend to provide a biased preference to some students of a particular graduate program, over other students of the very same educational program, in contradiction to Canada's publicly venerated charters and statutes? 

</details>


All of the above content was presented to UWaterloo officials and MBET management in Nov-Dec 2022, via electronic communications. The officers of UWaterloo in executive and leadership roles, initially remained muted about the issues stemming from discrimination based PGWP and TRV provisions. Eventually their official response, provided in Feb-2023, they stated that they did not agree to any of the points presented to them, that they along their staff and faculty members were not wrong in any manner whatsoever, denied responsibility for providing any misleading official documents to any students, and were not going to comment any further about the presented matter. 

Of course, it would be terribly unfortunate if UWaterloo were to try to scapegoat MBET faculty and staff, in the aftermath of these provable issues. Eventually, UWaterloo's provosts, and the Ontario Education Ministry may come to realize that denying or delaying justice in this matter, will tank the MBET program as well as the Conrad School of Business and Entrepreneurship. Such an outcome would undoubtedly lead to a much worse debacle, and a crisis for Ontario, with yearly public outcries from MBET graduates as well as from other UWaterloo student bodies and alumni.

The accreditation authorities for university programs might also try to create distance from UWaterloo, or evade responsibility for maintaining appropriate educational standards pertaining to various study programs in Ontario's DLIs. They may claim that their scope of inspection and examination, limited them from observing the ongoing international scams conducted via MBET in UWaterloo, and by MBET like programs in other educational institutes. Of course, Universities Canada may soon recognize, and admit that anything related to the superficiality of "entrepreneurship", possibly cannot be accredited, and made standardized across educational institutions and centers.  

The example set by the Ontario Ministry of Education going forward, by not reprimanding UWaterloo's leadership, and by not satisfactorily resolving this problem with proper remedies and compensations paid out to wronged individuals, can only create a dangerous and bad precedent. Such a bad precedent would allow many more DLIs to orchestrate much worse abuses of the trust, that is invested daily by local and international students in the Canadian educational system, and in Canada as a whole.  

As for IRCC, it will not be able to walk away from this situation scot-free. That much is guaranteed because of the egregious and wretched nature of the scam it has actively participated in, and in the cover up of discrimination based wrongdoings committed by multiple echelons of public officials in Ontario, who coordinate with IRCC on a regular basis. That type of a cover up is in itself enervating because of the deliberately deceptive methods used by IRCC, to obfuscate how it hinders immigration pathways of
profiled and targeted graduate students.

There is no point in scapegoating a few immigration officers from IRCC, and claiming that only "a few" entry-level, application processing officers were duped, by ambiguous wording within official documents provided to graduating students, by programs like UWaterloo's MBET. It is clear that IRCC has been part-taking in a discrimination based social order, that hides behind a wall of silence, indemnity, and impunity. And it does so, to systematically harm particular groups of people, all the while abusing official protocols and statutes. 

The conniving hypocrisy of IRCC, and abject betrayals of trust committed by DLIs like UWaterloo, will not be forgotten, and they are yet to be forgiven because those state-sponsored actors continue to double down on their dishonorable deeds, each and every day, without any sense of remorse or repentance.  

The crooked and sly cover ups, of the ongoing international-scale scams, and discriminatory abuses committed via IRCC and the likes of MBET in UWaterloo, that have continuously allowed international students to get baited and systematically harmed, is hideously tragic, cunningly cruel, utterly woeful, and outrageously awful.
