### 2.3.1.3 International-Scale Crimes of Tax-Evasion, Bribery, and Art Theft
Within organized crimes, one of the eventual chores is to pay out the members of the crime syndicate, in a currency that is sufficiently tangible and legitimate in the eyes of the rest of the world, where that currency can be spent by the newly enriched bosses and underlings. Such persons who reap undue gains and unearned profits from a racket, are often too acutely aware that immediately spending any misappropriated capital, in an open and regulated market, only brings unwanted attention towards their ongoing illicit and unwholesome activities. So, a sophisticated ring engaged in profiteering usually finds a "store of financial value" that can be easily distributed as a whole, or as fractional parts, in a somewhat fungible form to the crime syndicate's beneficiaries. Bosses and managers of the ring are also aware that the capital gained from their illegal activities, needs to evade the scrutiny of banking regulators, tax collection authorities, customs and border petrol officers, and any close relationships of the syndicate's members, aside from the gaze of lay onlookers, who aren't in on the racket. 

A preferred method of converting misappropriated capital for such firms engaged in illegitimate activities is through the acquisition and transfer of collectible items that can be lent, traded, or auctioned at a later time. Collectibles that fit the constraints of a crime syndicate's fencing operations include items like rare stamps, pieces of artwork, historical and cultural artifacts, heirlooms, vintage cars, corporate shares, as well as any such materials like precious gems and jeweler that need to be "appraised", before being sold off for a particular amount of fiat currency. Such items are then fenced through various auction houses, store fronts and outlets, by selling them to buyers who have a clean track-record and who happen to make the purchase of said collectibles, with their legitimately earned money.  

It is indeed considerably difficult for law-enforcement agencies to identify and track monetary assets, that are of an "alternative nature", compared to ownership documents of land parcels, bank notes, and other forms of serial numbered paper currencies like municipal bonds, or treasury bonds. It is even more difficult when such items are smuggled across international waters and borders, bouncing across the world via the aid of proxy agents who willingly or unwittingly end up working for a criminal enterprise's scams, and schemes. 

Other ways crime syndicates pay out to their favored members, and associates, is through bribes that allow the fruitful usage of vehicles, production tools and materials, real estate properties, discounted professional services, and "access" to higher privileges in a community — without the actual transfer of ownership rights to those forms of capital. 

Let us now look at a few anecdotal examples of a set of gray-area transactions which have involved entities from Kitchener-Waterloo Region of Ontario, Canada, and other internationally located individuals or groups.

<details><summary><h4>A) How to hide corporate losses while funneling money to offshore reserves in the name of supporting "young entrepreneurs."</h4></summary> 
 
Suppose you happen to be a senior manager in a multi-national corporation situated in Seattle, Washington, USA. The year is 2015-2016 and you've had an underwhelming financial year because the profits from your computer-chip manufacturing business has fallen short of investor expectations, and your company as a whole has underperformed in share markets compared to your competitors — by a significant margin. You need to somehow offload your loss generating projects, deffer payments of taxes to a later financial year to pad the coming year's balance sheets, find ways to cut budgets, make some layoffs, and try to gin up some excitement about your brand as well as your company's future outlook. You realize that you  need to make some quick and tough decisions, to appease you company's boardroom attendees who only care about numbers published in quarterly earnings reports. 

Somehow, you notice a startup company called Thalmic Labs launched from a Canadian university called UWaterloo. The founders and members of the startup seem upbeat and they are seeking partners from the high-end tech industry. The product they intend to make and sell called Myo Band, is clearly a gimmick, but an effective one at that, for it has managed to grab your attention in a way that other startups from the US and other regions of the world haven't. You figure that they will soon enough need an industry partner's help, to pivot away form their current technology venture. 

A novel but languishing project from your company has been trying to promote a technology development kit for building computer-vision based products. It includes a proprietary software application programming interface, and some hardware with cameras and microprocessors built using your latest chipset designed for mobiles and wearables. This dev-kit is specifically aimed at machine learning based applications that utilize eye-tracking, stereoscopic depth mapping, and augmented reality.

You acquiesces yourself with members and existing partners of Thalmic Labs by having them arrange a meeting with your team. You then convince them that you will invest in their company, for your business philosophy is to "invest in the people and the long-term vision of a company that you can believe in, and not merely in the company's product mix or service offerings." You pitch them your financial support, access to world-class engineers and managers as mentors, the prestige of being associated with your brand, and your computer-vision related dev-kit. They ask you how the dev-kit's software and hardware for tiny cameras is going help them bring their Myo Band to the market. You bluntly tell them that it simply isn't going to do anything of that sort. They get the picture and the idea you've pitched to them. They are more than glad to partner with you, and they are more than happy to "move on" from their previous efforts in making something futuristic, for the particular markets they were aiming to cater to. You find some satisfaction and contentment in the fact that a bunch of people high on *bromance and startup fever*, aren't as dumb as they have otherwise appeared to be to others. 

Thalmic Labs gets rebranded as North. It pivots to making something like Google Glass in "stealth-mode." You start to smoothly move a few distressed assets and funds to a corporate entity in Canada that is innocuously called North Inc., which isn't your subsidiary nor a proper joint venture partner. In your books you bury such transactions as Research and Development (R&D) expenses, and you even try to showcase your, otherwise legitimate seeming association with the startup, as an act of corporate social responsibility. Your company's team becomes a set of all-round, god-father like figures to North's co-founders and employees. Members of your team advertise North's efforts to US military and defense contractors, suggesting that the eventual "secret sauce" and technology developed through such R&D efforts, could very well be used as heads-up display, mounted in protective eye-ware or helmets, for soldiers and pilots. To other big-tech companies, a similar idea is advertised with the view that North's work outputs, irrespective of production delays or potential violations of plagiarism, can be used in lightweight headsets for virtual reality applications, to provide a cutting-edge against products from HTC, Meta, and Samsung. 

Within a year, North comes out of stealth-mode to reveal that it has been making catchy eye-ware with features for augmented reality. The release date for their product isn't announced; public's focus and attention is instead drawn to their new offices and cool headquarters in Kitchener, Ontario.

Few tax-credits from Canada's Revenue Agency trickle into the accounts of North, for "Scientific Research & Experimental Development" carried out by the company and its investors. A number of new high-tech jobs are created in Kitchener through North, which makes the city's local politicians joyful. The rent paid to the owner of North's office buildings generates yearly tax-revenues that makes the region's, and province's politicians happy. The extremely entrepreneurial landlord takes a piece of the pie he receives as yearly rent money from North, to frequently do a bit of back-channeling for "peace in the Middle-East", in-line with the late Yasser Arafat's version of geo-political power brokering between Palestinians, Arab Israelis, and Jewish settlers, who happen to live in and around Haifa, Jerusalem as well as the Gaza Strip. May God rest Yasser Arafat's soul in peace, and grant a bit more wisdom, scruples, and scrupulousness to those who may have a shrine dedicated to him in their office. 

Those back-channeled financing efforts to support various 'activists and peace workers', that go undetected by international policing agencies, happen to be "'gifts' from Canada to various factions in Israel for the furtherance of peace in the Middle East." Those so-called gifts are even blessed and approved by the Vatican, apart from being backed by a few incumbent government officials in Canada, "for making the world a better place." How can gray-area shady deals and international-scale clandestine operations ever succeed, without the Pope's approbations, right?   

You pat yourself on the back for a job well done, and continue to shuffle around debts and revenues within your Seattle based company's accounts, with the liabilities and assets of fledgling companies across boarders, for the purposes of "bringing promising startups and new companies into the folds of your multi-national company's 'ecosystem'."

Seeing all of this, executive members and the leadership of UWaterloo rejoice, and start promoting "The Way of The True North", as a set of cultural and 'entrepreneurial' practices, to students of programs like Velocity and MBET. Students and startup founders in the region are prodded to be more like North, which is poised for: exponential growth as a leader and innovator within the augmented reality market space, in the world-wide arena of import and export business of cutting-edge technology.  

But then the pandemic happens, and Google acquires North. That counts as a reasonable financial success for a company that kept making futuristic gimmicks and vapor-ware, doesn't it? 

>Perhaps North manged to make some kind of a secret sauce which caused it to get acquired by Google. Or maybe it was just irritating for Google to watch somebody down the street from them, steal their spotlight and glory, with something even more "lightweight" than [Google Cardboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cardboard).
