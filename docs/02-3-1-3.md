### 2.3.1.3 International-Scale Crimes of Tax-Evasion, Bribery, and Art Theft
Within organized crimes, one of the eventual chores is to make payments to the members of the crime syndicate for their supportive efforts and loyalties, in a currency that is sufficiently tangible and legitimate in the eyes of the rest of the world, where that currency can be spent by the newly enriched bosses and underlings. Such persons who reap undue gains and unearned profits from a racket, are often too acutely aware that immediately spending any misappropriated capital, in an open and regulated market, only brings unwanted attention towards their ongoing illicit and unwholesome activities. So, a sophisticated ring engaged in profiteering, usually finds a "store of financial value" that can be easily distributed as a whole, or as fractional parts, in a somewhat fungible form to the crime syndicate's beneficiaries. Bosses and managers of the ring are also aware that the capital gained from their illegal activities, needs to evade the scrutiny of banking regulators, tax collection authorities, customs and border patrol officers, and any close relationships of the syndicate's members, aside from the gaze of lay onlookers, who aren't in on the racket. 

For such firms engaged in illegitimate activities, a preferred method of converting misappropriated resources and capital, into fiat currency, is through the acquisition and transfer of collectible items, that can be lent, traded, or auctioned at a later date and time. Collectibles that fit the constraints of a crime syndicate's fencing operations, include items like rare stamps, pieces of artwork, historical and cultural artifacts, heirlooms, vintage cars, corporate shares, as well as any materials like precious gems and jeweler that need to be "appraised", before being sold off for a particular amount of a fiat currency. Such items are then fenced through various auction houses, store fronts and outlets, by selling them to buyers who have a clean track-record and who happen to make the purchase of said collectibles, with their legitimately earned money.  

It is indeed considerably difficult for law-enforcement agencies to identify and track monetary assets, that are of an "alternative nature", compared to ownership documents of land parcels, bank notes, and other forms of serial numbered paper currencies like municipal bonds, or treasury bonds. It is even more difficult when such items are smuggled across international waters and borders, bouncing across the world via the aid of proxy agents who willingly or unwittingly end up working for a criminal enterprise's scams, and schemes. 

Other ways crime syndicates pay out to their favored members, and associates, is through bribes that allow the fruitful usage of vehicles, production tools and materials, real estate properties, discounted professional services, and "access" to higher privileges in a community — without the actual transfer of ownership rights to those forms of capital. 

Let us now look at a few anecdotal examples of a set of gray-area transactions which have involved entities from Kitchener-Waterloo Region of Ontario, Canada, and other internationally located individuals or groups. 

<br>
<p>You may click the <img width="1%" src="./img/solid_white-pointing_right-triangle.png"></img> icon below, to read an euphemistic anecdote.</p>

<details><summary><h4>A) How to hide corporate losses while funneling money to offshore reserves in the name of supporting "young entrepreneurs."</h4></summary> 
 
Suppose you happen to be a senior manager in a multi-national corporation situated in Seattle, Washington, USA. The year is 2015-2016 and you've had an underwhelming financial year because the profits from your computer-chip manufacturing business has fallen short of investor expectations, and your company as a whole has underperformed in share markets compared to your competitors — by a significant margin. You need to somehow offload your loss generating projects, deffer payments of taxes to a later financial year to pad the coming year's balance sheets, find ways to cut budgets, make some layoffs, and try to gin up some excitement about your brand as well as your company's future outlook. You realize that you  need to make some quick and tough decisions, to appease you company's boardroom meeting attendees who only care about numbers published in quarterly earnings reports. 

Somehow, you notice a startup company called Thalmic Labs launched from a Canadian university called UWaterloo. The founders and members of the startup seem upbeat and they are seeking partners from the high-end tech industry. The product they intend to make and sell called Myo Band, is clearly a gimmick, but an effective one at that, for it has managed to grab your attention in a way that other startups from the US and other regions of the world haven't. You figure that they will soon enough need an industry partner's help, to pivot away form their current technology venture. 

A novel but languishing project from your company has been trying to promote a technology development kit for building computer-vision based products. It includes a proprietary software application programming interface, and some hardware with cameras and microprocessors built using your latest chipset designed for mobiles and wearables. This dev-kit is specifically aimed at machine learning based applications that utilize eye-tracking, stereoscopic depth mapping, and augmented reality.

You acquiesces yourself with members and existing partners of Thalmic Labs by having them arrange a meeting with your team. You then convince them that you will invest in their company, for your business philosophy is to "invest in the people and the long-term vision of a company that you can believe in, and not merely in the company's product mix or service offerings." You pitch them your financial support, access to world-class engineers and managers as mentors, the prestige of being associated with your brand, and your computer-vision related dev-kit. They ask you how the dev-kit's software and hardware for tiny cameras is going help them bring their Myo Band to the market. You bluntly tell them that it simply isn't going to do anything of that sort. They get the picture and the idea you've pitched to them. They are more than glad to partner with you, and they are more than happy to "move on" from their previous efforts in making something futuristic, for the particular markets they were aiming to cater to. You find some satisfaction and contentment in the fact that a bunch of people high on *bromance and startup fever*, aren't as dumb as they have otherwise appeared to be to others. 

Thalmic Labs gets rebranded as North. It pivots to making something like Google Glass in "stealth-mode." You start to smoothly move a few distressed assets and funds to a corporate entity in Canada that is innocuously called North Inc., which isn't your subsidiary nor a proper joint venture partner. In your books you bury such transactions as Research and Development (R&D) expenses, and you even try to showcase your, otherwise legitimate seeming association with the startup, as an act of corporate social responsibility. Your company's team becomes a set of all-round, god-father like figures to North's co-founders and employees. Members of your team advertise North's efforts to US military and defense contractors, suggesting that the eventual "secret sauce" and technology developed through such R&D efforts, could very well be used as heads-up display, mounted in protective eye-ware or helmets, for soldiers and pilots. To other big-tech companies, a similar idea is advertised with the view that North's work outputs, irrespective of production delays or potential violations of plagiarism, can be used in lightweight headsets for virtual reality applications, to provide a cutting-edge against products from HTC, Meta, and Samsung. 

Within a year, North comes out of stealth-mode to reveal that it has been making catchy eye-ware with features for augmented reality. The release date for their product isn't announced; public's focus and attention is instead drawn to their new offices and cool headquarters in Kitchener, Ontario.

Few tax-credits from Canada's Revenue Agency trickle into the accounts of North, for "Scientific Research & Experimental Development" carried out by the company and its investors. A number of new high-tech jobs are created in Kitchener through North, which makes the city's local politicians joyful. The rent paid to the owner of North's office buildings generates yearly tax-revenues that makes the region's, and province's politicians happy. The extremely entrepreneurial landlord takes a piece of the pie he receives as yearly rent money from North, to frequently do a bit of back-channeling for "peace in the Middle-East", in-line with the late Yasser Arafat's version of geo-political power brokering between Palestinians, Arab Israelis, and Jewish settlers, who happen to live in and around Haifa, Jerusalem as well as the Gaza Strip. May God rest Yasser Arafat's soul in peace, and grant a bit more wisdom, scruples, and scrupulousness to those who may have a shrine dedicated to him in their office. 

Those back-channeled financing efforts to support various 'activists and peace workers', that go undetected by international policing agencies, happen to be "'gifts' from Canada to various factions in Israel for the furtherance of peace in the Middle East." Those so-called gifts are even blessed and approved by the Vatican, apart from being backed by a few incumbent government officials in Canada, "for making the world a better place." 

>How can gray-area shady deals, and international-scale clandestine operations, ever permeate through the world, without the Pope's approbations, right?   

You pat yourself on the back for a job well done, and continue to shuffle around debts and revenues within your Seattle based company's accounts, with the liabilities and assets of fledgling companies across boarders, for the purposes of "bringing promising startups and new companies into the folds of your multi-national company's 'ecosystem'."

Seeing all of this, executive members and the leadership of UWaterloo rejoice, and start promoting "The Way of The True North", as a set of cultural and 'entrepreneurial' practices, to students of programs like Velocity and MBET. Students and startup founders in the region are prodded to be more like North, which is poised for: exponential growth as a leader and innovator within the augmented reality market space, in the world-wide arena of import and export business of cutting-edge technology.  

But then the pandemic happens, and Google acquires North. That counts as a reasonable financial success for a company that kept making futuristic gimmicks and vapor-ware, doesn't it? 

>Perhaps North manged to make some kind of a secret sauce which caused it to get acquired by Google. Or maybe it was just irritating for Google to watch somebody down the street from them, steal their spotlight and glory, with something even more "lightweight" than [Google Cardboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cardboard).

<details><summary><h4>B) How to run your own tuck shop and religious cult, from within a Canadian university.</h4></summary> 

During the mid-2000s, when a number of local hard money lenders were brought into the fold of MBET's Conrad Center, to help the center grow and attract more international students from particular countries like Mexico and India, the deal struck with them was of a slightly more "noble" nature. Loan sharks typically want their money back, with steep interests on the principal that was lent by them. However, simply being rich and having boat loads of cash, still does not bring with it the socio-political privileges, that come from having a dynastic legacy within a province, or a state. 

The founding members and executives of the MBET program had promised a number of local "donors", naming rights and other privileges, in consideration for their financial contributions and social support for the Conrad Center. With the cash infusion, the program and its center were able to hire more esteemed faculty members from around the country, as well as enhance their marketing operations by sending a ~~missionary~~ representative of the program, to targeted countries. Those types of marketing and outreach campaigns have been an ongoing effort of the MBET program, since two decades. Their main objective has been to increase MBET's visibility in comparison to authentic study programs, within trade shows and conferences where North American, European and Australian universities pitch themselves and their programs, to prospective students. Such trade shows and conferences are held each year, within multiple cities of the countries that can supply North America, Europe, and Australia with a constant influx of ["apt pupils."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apt_Pupil#Plot_summary)

However, not all of the family names of the donors could be given sufficient visibility and appreciation, by:
- establishing a foundation or a trust within the university in their honor,  

- having their name prominently displayed on placards among the university's buildings,  

- and regularly acknowledging their "generous" contributions during events hosted by UWaterloo's MBET program.  

So those ~~donors~~ financial backers had to be appeased and paid a return on their investment, in other ways. This is where we have to first discuss the value of smuggled cultural heritage and artwork, from countries in Oceania, Asia, South America, and Africa. 

People with colonialist and supremacist mentality have a peculiar fascination with robbing various cultural artifacts from invaded countries, and then putting those artifacts on display in their public spaces like museums, as well as on a mantel in their private homes and offices. They even come up with nationalized laws that make it legal for them to retain any stolen materials, and even trafficked human beings as well as animals, that have been brought into their country through any conceivable means. The dastardly and fiendish nature of such acts, is simply incorrigible, as they have been ongoing for more than a century. 

However, Canada does not like to portray itself, as a self-absolving colonialist state (like France, Britain, and the US), which has *a god-given-right* to keep stealing pieces of national heritage from other countries, through various overt and covert means. But it turns out that particular state-affiliated and state-sponsored actors in Canada, do enjoy the luxury of owning and displaying national heritage artwork, transferred into their possession from "exotic" countries.  

How are those cultural artifacts brought into the possession of certain Canadian agents? This is where we can return to our discussion about the role of university professors and faculty, in aiding and abetting acts of smuggling contraband, apart from storing and distributing said contraband.  

By the way, Canada doesn't yet have strict and heavily enforced statutory laws, that allow it to retain stolen and smuggled cultural artifacts, the way France and Britain do.  

Groups of Canadian citizens and residents affiliated with universities like UWaterloo, show up in countries like Philippines, Tanzania, and Peru, in the name of doing anthropological research and archaeology. Other university affiliates and family members accompany them, in the name of strengthening economic and cultural ties with the host country, while promoting tourism. During their visit, they purchase seemingly unimportant and low-cost artifacts as souvenirs supplied to them from a local agent within the host country. The group then returns to Canada, having passed through border and customs checks, without even needing to declare that each person in the group, only has couple of trinkets or memorabilia. The faculty members who are supposed experts in the study of the particular region's culture, from where they happen to have brought a number of artifacts into Canada, store those pieces of art in their homes, often, in plain sight. Those pieces of art have the usual ethnic motifs of the region they are from, but there isn't an easy way to discern if those are rare pieces of national heritage stolen from a country such as India. 

Here is the cleverness and smoothness of their operations which is centered around evasion, and *plausible deniability:* 

1. If anything ever goes wrong, the professors and their family members can claim that the local agent in the artifact's country of origin, who had offered them with an option to purchase a piece of art "as a souvenir", led them to believe that the artifact was manufactured by local artisans, and wasn't otherwise a rare piece of stolen good with historical significance, that would have otherwise counted as a piece of national heritage. The artifact appeared practically worthless, and they were more than generous in offering a "fair price" for purchasing the shown item, which they further thought, was at least a way to help "the poor seller."  

1. But why would anything even go wrong? Who could possibly suspect reputable professors as being greedy international smugglers? Faculty and staff from universities aren't thugs. They are simply middle class people who do their usual touristy or academic things within the countries they visit, right?  

1. Slightly heavier items like statues and vases made of ceramics, minerals, stones, glass, metals, or wood are placed in the carry-on-luggage of younger family members, or accompanying students. Customs and border agents looking for narcotics, explosives, sharps, and firearms using x-ray machines, typically ignore silly pieces of trinkets carried by harmless looking youngsters. The total wight of items that a group can thus transfer into Canada, becomes hundreds of kilos per trip. And there might be at least, one or two official trips conducted by the group each year, for the purposes of "field studies." 

    1. Plus, university stipends and grants support such official trips, often, directly from the university's bank accounts. So there are absolutely no indicators that would otherwise cause the funding source of the travel tickets used by the group, to get flagged by any authorities. :bowtie::+1:  

1. The artifacts brought into Canada are handed to other members of the syndicate awaiting a payment, as "gifts."

1. If an artifact has to be certified as being nominal, or as highly valuable and authentic, the authoritative person to do so, happens to be a member from the group who is also reputed as, "the subject matter expert", for appraising the particular artifact. This is where the deception and dishonesty involved in appraising the item, becomes conveniently hidden from the eyes of lay persons and even investigators. 

1. Group members then host "silent auctions" and other such events. They do so, often for the laudable purposes of raising charity or awareness, for a popular social cause. In this manner, a non-fungible item is laundered and converted into local currency, that is pocketed by the managers of the event, as a "modest" management fees. The greater profits acquired by the managers of such high-society events, are in the form of socio-political influence and prestige, gained through ordinary people residing within the local region, and province, who get drawn to those events. 

    1. A person needing to pay homage or tribute to the syndicate, can pay a sizable sum of money, for a seemingly decorative artifact that has quaint ethnic motifs. For a person aspiring to win the syndicate's favors, endearing up to its core group, usually requires quite a few acts of "gift-giving", with items that can be auctioned being presented at private dinner parties. 

    1. Such nuances of establishing social accord with a network of influential people, aren't taught directly in MBET classes. They might however, be suggested in subtle ways by "a mentor", often outside of campus settings, in a tone indicating that the student ought to adopt local customs, and the shown business etiquette. 

        - *"Take the hint, and get with the program!"*

    1. Ones who don't get with the program, are marginalized and deemed "uncoachable." 

1. Merely transferring cultural artifacts and other collectibles into Canada, from various countries, and then converting those items into money or instruments of political gift-giving, isn't a sufficient form of enrichment for some members in UWaterloo. There are those, who start their own little shop, and start selling their books along with tickets to "retreats", in the guise of promoting religious syncretism, through those books, and at those 'benign' retreats.  

    1. Yes, those types of cliques invariably turn into deeper, fraudulent scams and cults, thrust upon susceptible students and community members.

To learn more about how and when I discovered one of them, and also to learn a bit more about who I am, or what I am, you may take a stroll through [*Appendix IV of The File.*](https://github.com/true-hindsight/grim-realities/blob/main/navigating-this-gitrepo.md#20-navigating-this-documentation)
