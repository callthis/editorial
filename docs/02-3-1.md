### 2.3.1 Organized Crimes

The standard ploy orchestrated by a crime syndicate, basically involves sustaining an injurious culture against targeted groups of people, through particular sets of education and training programs, propagated among social as well as professional groups that are affiliated with the overall syndicate. Harmful cultural practices promoted by such a firm or a conglomerate, are geared towards theft of equity, assets, and emoluments through the exploitation of targeted groups of people. Leaders and authority figures of the syndicate, systematically "coach and mentor" their subordinate members, to willfully ignore the deleterious interaction effects on human ecology, generated via coordinated activities among producers, consultants, marketers, sellers, managers, enforcers, and users affiliated with the syndicate. A syndicate's or firm's direct as well as indirect activities, that negatively impact individuals being subjected to harms, and various forms of exploitation, are thus kept under shrouds of secrecy and willful ignorance. In this manner, unethical firms are able to sustain their harmful and illegitimate activities via misdirection. Additionally, propagating a culture of "turning a blind-eye" towards harms suffered by victims and survivors of organized crimes, allows the offensive syndicate to maintain its profits and "appreciable" social standing. Such a foul and problematic culture is accepted among various officiated "keepers and referees", at the municipal, provincial, and federal levels of governments, as being perfectly normal, because it privately benefits those officials. 

The socio-economic and political benefits obtained by complicit members of public institutions, arise from being partisan to, or from having some type of participatory involvement in crime syndicates. More difficult to excavate bribes materialize from various kinds of favors traded by elected and appointed public officials with a firm, while appearing to be, at least, at a distance of an "arms-length" from known members of the firm. Some public officials also tend to derive direct benefits from a crime syndicate, by simply being on its payrolls. 

The harmful firm or conglomerate, thus maintains its controlling position within the public realm, through its "business operations", while profiting from seemingly positive, "synergistic interactions" propagated by its groups of accommodating affiliates, on behalf of so-called end-consumers.
