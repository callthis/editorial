### Bigotry and Racial Prejudices Embedded Within The Functions of IRCC

The following discussion isn't from my 'limited and constricted' viewpoint of Canadian society, it is a straightforward comparison of Nazi literature and IRCC's foundational principles. The comparison, factually demonstrates the true nature and source of IRCC's motivations, in selectively harming newcomers to Canada, by underhandedly erecting hidden barriers within the path towards residency and citizenship, against profiled and targeted newcomers. By continuing to doing so even in this day and age, the IRCC has deprived numerous innocent individuals and families, on a daily basis, of their rightful entitlements for an appropriate legal status in Canada, while betraying their trust, and not treating them with the required honesty, respect, equity, safety, and dignity they most certainly deserve. 

The physical and socio-economic damages generated as a result of IRCC's dishonesty and treachery, only leads to devastation and deprivation, suffered by people who cannot even properly identify how they came to be ruinously harmed. The inability of harmed individuals to seek justice and recompense, has been mainly due to the stealthy and pernicious nature of the state-sponsored apparatus deployed against them. 

Let us first look at the Nazi literature produced by Franz Pfeffer von Salomon, and then compare it to the principles and statutory mechanisms used by IRCC. 

One can read about the Nazi ideology proposed by Franz Pfeffer in "Chapter 60 - Barren Trees" of the book titled, "Fascism," that has been edited and compiled by Roger Griffin [^1]. Franz Pfeffer's political and sociological ideology proposed a method for breeding a new race of white supremacy by weeding out 'inferior races' through Eugenics. Franz Pfeffer also promoted the
idea of fundamental inequality, even among Nordic, Germanic, as well as other European, and Eurasian people, due to his notions about differences at the group level of human social behavior which he believed, arose strictly from an individual's genetics and skills. This form of ableism and Nazi rhetoric, was formalized by Franz Pfeffer in his writings, which were adopted by the [Sturmabteilung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung) (The Nazi *SA* group), and fanatically enforced by the [Schutzstaffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel) (The Nazi *SS* group).

The main programmatic principles and criteria of The Nazi SA and SS, are quoted here using an extended quotation from Barren Trees. The main principles and criteria of Canada's immigration policies have similar verbiage and identical semantic content as these quoted Nazi principles and ideas. Though Canada's immigration policies have been amended numerous times, since the inception of Canadian constitutional laws, its core contents that match the Nazi program have remained unaltered, and have remained identical to points 1) through 4), in the following excerpt from Franz Pfeffer's writings:

"All Germans are unequal. That is the starting-point. [...] The first logical conclusion to be drawn from inequality is the inequality of value. Some Germans are more valuable than others. A logical consequence of this inequality must be the principle of unequal treatment, that is, unequal share of state power, property, culture. All these must be distributed to people on the basis of how valuable they are. [...] A further logical consequence of inequality in what people are worth, and the continuous changes brought about by the development of the nation, is the duty of the state to take charge of this development, which means influencing it in every way possible. Excellence must be increased and enhanced further. Inferiority must be reduced. In plain terms this is a question of breeding. Improving the stock of the race. [...] From the above considerations I can draw up the following programmatic demands of our future state. [...] To determine the degree of higher or lower value of all inhabitants of Germany, the value will be assessed as the function of four criteria:
