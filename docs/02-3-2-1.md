### 2.3.2.1 Bigotry and Racial Prejudices Embedded Within The Functions of IRCC

The following discussion isn't from my 'limited and constricted' viewpoint of Canadian society, it is a straightforward comparison of Nazi literature and IRCC's foundational principles. The comparison, factually demonstrates the true nature and source of IRCC's motivations, in selectively harming newcomers to Canada, by underhandedly erecting hidden barriers within the path towards residency and citizenship, against profiled and targeted newcomers. By continuing to doing so even in this day and age, the IRCC has deprived numerous innocent individuals and families, on a daily basis, of their rightful entitlements for an appropriate legal status in Canada, while betraying their trust, and not treating them with the required honesty, respect, equity, safety, and dignity they most certainly deserve. 

The physical and socio-economic damages generated as a result of IRCC's dishonesty and treachery, only leads to devastation and deprivation, suffered by people who cannot even properly identify how they came to be ruinously harmed. The inability of harmed individuals to seek justice and recompense, has been mainly due to the stealthy and pernicious nature of the state-sponsored apparatus deployed against them. 

Let us first look at the Nazi literature produced by Franz Pfeffer von Salomon, and then compare it to the principles and statutory mechanisms used by IRCC. 

One can read about the Nazi ideology proposed by Franz Pfeffer in "Chapter 60 - Barren Trees" of the book titled, "Fascism," that has been edited and compiled by Roger Griffin [^1]. Franz Pfeffer's political and sociological ideology proposed a method for breeding a new race of white supremacy by weeding out 'inferior races' through Eugenics. Franz Pfeffer also promoted the
idea of fundamental inequality, even among Nordic, Germanic, as well as other European, and Eurasian people, due to his notions about differences at the group level of human social behavior which he believed, arose strictly from an individual's genetics and skills. This form of ableism and Nazi rhetoric, was formalized by Franz Pfeffer in his writings, which were adopted by the [Sturmabteilung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung) (The Nazi *SA* group), and fanatically enforced by the [Schutzstaffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel) (The Nazi *SS* group).

The main programmatic principles and criteria of The Nazi SA and SS, are quoted here using an extended quotation from Barren Trees. The main principles and criteria of Canada's immigration policies have similar verbiage and identical semantic content as these quoted Nazi principles and ideas. Though Canada's immigration policies have been amended numerous times, since the inception of Canadian constitutional laws, its core contents that match the Nazi program have remained unaltered, and have remained identical to points 1) through 4), termed as the criteria for putting a value on human lives, in the following excerpt from Franz Pfeffer's writings —

```
"All Germans are unequal. That is the starting-point. [...] The first logical conclusion to be drawn from inequality is the
 inequality of value. Some Germans are more valuable than others. A logical consequence of this inequality must be the
 principle of unequal treatment, that is, unequal share of state power, property, culture. All these must be distributed to
 people on the basis of how valuable they are. [...] A further logical consequence of inequality in what people are worth,
 and the continuous changes brought about by the development of the nation, is the duty of the state to take charge of this
 development, which means influencing it in every way possible. 
 
 Excellence must be increased and enhanced further. Inferiority must be reduced. In plain terms this is a question of breeding.
 Improving the stock of the race. [...] 
 
 From the above considerations I can draw up the following programmatic demands of our future state. [...] To determine the
 degree of higher or lower value of all inhabitants of Germany, the value will be assessed as the function of four criteria:

 1. Actual performance in their professions
 
 2. Physical attributes according to health and racial characteristics
 
 3. Spiritual, moral and cultural traits
 
 4. Hereditary traits evaluated by considering parents and grandparents
 
 No pity is to be shown to those who occupy the lower categories of the inferior groups: cripples, epileptics, the blind,
 the insane, the deaf and dumb, children born in sanatoria for alcoholics or in care, orphans, children born out of wedlock, 
 criminals, whores, the sexually disturbed, etc. Everything done for them not only means taking resources away from more
 deserving causes but counteracts the breeding selection process. Nor should we mourn the dumb, the week, the spineless, the
 apathetic, those with hereditary diseases, the pathological, because they go under 'innocently.' [...] This bottom category
 means destruction and death. Weighed and found wanting. Trees which do not bear fruit should be cut down and thrown into the
 fire."
```

Any individual who goes through the Canadian immigration process via its Permanent Residency or Citizenship programs, is subject to the above type of humiliating, and degrading, selection and selective breeding process, by being meticulously prodded, poked, and inspected by state-sponsored doctors. Those Canadian state-sponsored doctors are charged with the responsibility of evaluating every portion of a newcomer's body, behavior, cultural outlook, educational background, skill sets, aptitudes, earning potential, and even genetics (via illegally obtained genetic material) — to decide on whether the state-mandated criteria of fitness, and the requirements for assimilation into existing Canadian main-stream society, can be fulfilled by the newcomer.

The graded and sifted immigrants, as well as refugees (including prisoners of war who are illegitimately labeled as refugees) are then systematically slotted into a low paying dull-dirty-dangerous job, as determined by the immigration and labor requirements of various Canadian provinces. This keeps the newcomers stuck in a debt-trap.

Evidence from daily lives of numerous newcomers, including mine, proves that the 'immigrant and refugee stock' are systematically denied opportunities to seek and avail better educational, healthcare, socio-economic, political, and living conditions within Canada, through the use of overt and covert discriminatory policies, and behaviors, undertaken by key organizations belonging to Canada's public as well as private sectors. Societal conditions in Canada have become as though, it is customary for members of various private and public organizations to be racist. Upon hearing people defend the racially motivated policies and practices for "who gets stay in, and who gets to stay out or gets driven out of Canada", it appears that members at every echelon of Canadian institutions are somehow proud, to further cultivate and propagate their racist customs.

Particularly the idea of "inequality and unequal treatment", which persists as an undercurrent within Canadian immigration and labor policies, is contrary to Canada's internationally promoted public image of a country that cherishes, "social equality, and equal treatment of all persons under fair legal frameworks." 

Of course, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the fiendish ideologies and designs, of racists like [Herbert Kitchener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Kitchener), [Franz Pfeffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Pfeffer_von_Salomon), and [Donald Ewen Cameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Ewen_Cameron) have deeply influenced the mindset, societal norms, and the earliest constitution of Canadian people. What is surprising is that those terrible ideologies have been retained at the very core of numerous Canadian public sector institutions and private organizations, even to this day, in the current scientific era. Worst of all, those racists are still celebrated in Canada and Britain, with the city of Kitchener, Ontario, being named after 'Lord' Herbert Kitchener. Additionally, existing schools of psychiatry in Western Europe as well as in North America, still venerate Donald Cameron as a 'founding father of modern psychiatry', and they still propagate his incorrigibly injurious approach to medical sciences.  

Perhaps the silver lining here is that, at least, Franz Pfeffer von Salomon isn't being publicly celebrated by Canadians, even though his ideologies and racist designs have been retained at the very core of Canada's immigration policies, and within formal protocols of Canada's governance systems.  

The culpability of Canadian states-persons, lawmakers, and legislators, in propagating racist designs and policies that produce heinous, genocidal activities, is utterly woeful. But, those racially prejudiced criminals in seats of high authority and political influence, are cleverly protected and indemnified. They are even given legal immunity by Canadian statutory laws and social norms, to allow them to perpetrate widespread and systematic crimes against humanity, through the use, misuse, and abuse of their official powers and authority. Such prejudiced and discriminatory practices ought to be immediately ended, and expunged from all Canadian legislation, and institutional policies, if Canada is to have any shred of moral decency, and constitutional legitimacy.
