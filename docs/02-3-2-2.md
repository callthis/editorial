### 2.3.2.2 Genocidal Activities Conducted by a Nexus of Canadian Institutions 

Had I not been working on drone technologies for American defense agencies during the years 2008-2009, via University of Iowa in the USA; and had I not witnessed mass murders of children and women in remote villages of Afghanistan committed by US-led armed forces during that time, I would have been a happy-go-lucky person the rest of my life in my twenties and thirties.  

The type of horrors and devastation I had to withstand from the year 2010 onward, are explained in *[Chapter 16, of the File.](https://github.com/true-hindsight/grim-realities/blob/main/navigating-this-gitrepo.md#20-navigating-this-documentation)* After picking up the remaining pieces of my life, I tried to move-on, and put the tragedies I had witnessed as well as suffered in person, behind me, to work on topics as far away from the concept of weaponry and "weaponization" of things. I spent more than seven years hiding and running away from units of American-led armed forces, which were targeting persons like Assange, Manning, and Snowden while using a whole new interpretation of the incumbent American government's maxim of, "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."  

I did not have the courage to speak up about what I had witnessed within battle-damage assessment videos that I had to review, as part of my work during the year 2008; nor did I want to reside in a country where I would be at constant risk from being targeted by policing, military, and para-military units of American agencies, if I were to provide a witness-statement to anyone. So I moved to Canada. Why Canada? I wasn't smart either, apart from being cowardly. Somehow, it had never occurred to me that Canadian institutions, agencies, and even corporate entities could be subservient to American ones. I had to learn that the hard way.
