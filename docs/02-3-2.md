### 2.3.2 Hate Crimes and Genocidal Activities

The injurious culture sustained by a set of colluding institutions and private organizations, against targeted groups of people, can be of a murderous nature, apart from an exploitative one. The coordinated efforts of a number of organizations, due to preconceived prejudices held by members of those organizations, can result in institutionalized practices, protocols, and policies that not only seek to subvert or marginalize a target group, but also to eliminate the targeted communities and individuals. 

The goal of eliminating, that is, killing the targeted persons, can be orchestrated by a racist regime in a overt way, or through more clandestine and surreptitious means. Activities that generate egregious bodily injuries, death, or inter-generational harm, especially against profiled individuals via cultural misappropriation and political abuse of sciences, are categorized as genocidal activities. The overt forms of genocide are undoubtedly fiendish, but the covert forms of genocide are most certainly more insidious than covert strategies and tactics of committing mass murder. 

Genocidal activities that are driven by indoctrination, hatred, or bigotry manifest in society as hate crimes, and premeditated homicides against targeted individuals, before they become normalized and industrially propagated, as full-fledged genocides against entire communities or groups of individuals. 

Even in situations where the targeted persons don't end up getting killed, or made permanently disabled, the act of driving people out of their homes, and away from a particular geographic region by causing disruptions to their household, is still genocidal. Chasing people away from their homes, and causing devastation to their source of livelihood, family life, civil liberties, and household conditions, through belligerent or subtle forms of harassment, are the main types of genocidal activities aimed at resource-grabbing, and "ethnic-cleansing." 

However, for a country like Canada, the act of appearing boldly racist and outright hostile to any community, has been too expensive, and simply unaffordable from a human resources perspective. The challenge for certain private and public institutions in Canada, isn't that practicing racism has been, is, and would continue to be dishonorable, inglorious, and disgraceful for the good of humanity; the challenge for racists within Canadian private and state-sponsored agencies, in being openly racist, is merely of inconvenience and of slightly uneconomic nature. Their attempts to implement openly confrontational forms of racist designs, have been somewhat hampered by what they like to pejoratively ascribe as [wokeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke) in North America. So, the preferred method of committing genocides in Canada against marginalized communities, has involved the use of anonymity and automation, along with a network of coordinated agencies which can perform their finite set of specialized actions, in subtle ways that are invisible to the public's eye. The eventual outcome of those subtle activities that are carried out in an industrially organized form, is to eliminate targeted persons using the guise of needing to provide commercial, or public services to the residents of a city, or a neighborhood. 

For racist organizations, Eugenics has been the most 'humane' and swift method of inflicting wounds upon target groups, such that the method of causing reproductive harms and injuries to targeted individuals, will not be viewed as being overtly destructive and lethal, by the rest of the world along with its international agencies concerned with human rights. Eugenics has continued to be the preferred method of, *"nipping the problem in the bud",* where the problem from their perspective, is the mixing of impure and unclean blood into the gene-pool of the more desirable race of human beings, within <ins>their</ins> homeland. Racist, state-sponsored organizations have typically used industrially orchestrated methods of sterilizing undesirable races of human beings, as part of their final solution to establishing the proper world order. According to their racist ideologies, the Master Race that is supposed to be at the helm of the "natural social order", and the "natural biological ranking" of all species, gets to decide which particular race of human beings belong at a particular level of the biological hierarchy, as envisioned by their standards. Even though the concept of a Master Race is horrendously absurd, racists believe that it is incumbent upon the Master Race to decide and enforce, by way of its manifest destiny and innate exceptionalism, which group of human beings along with each category of plants and animals on Earth, get to serve it in a particular utilitarian role and capacity. 

The dishonesty and hypocrisy of self-righteous institutions that exist in Canadian provinces, is evident in the way provincial and federal public-service units have continued to murder and marginalize indigenous communities. It is also evident in the way tax-funded organizations begin their meetings or events, with a paltry and empty gesture of saying "thanks" to the deceased tribes whose lands and resources were stolen through acts of genocide, to give way to the disgustingly polluting lifestyle of existing generations of settlers, and immigrants. The most significant evidence of normalized hypocrisy can be observed in the way provincial and federal governments, have continued to hem and haw about **reparations**, without ever doing anything that is serious and genuine towards reconciliation.   

To recapitulate:

>It is of utmost importance to observe and recognize that, exploitative violations committed against selectively targeted groups and individuals, are tantamount to genocidal activities when committed with designs that generate: 
>  
>- reproductive harms, bodily injuries, debilitation, pain or suffering from cruelties, degrading humiliation, psychological devastation, torment, torture, fatalities, financial losses, socio-economic damages, forced assimilation, habitat destruction, unlawful evictions, mass terror, promotion of sectarian hate groups, political suppression, and/or religious repression. 
>    
>Violations are also genocidal in nature when they involve actions for depriving, or degrading, the basic human rights and civil liberties of: profiled individuals who constitute a category, or a class, within or of themselves. Activities for profiling individuals and communities are typically committed on the basis of: 
>
>- age, gender, creed, region of birth, ethnicity, skin color, sexual orientation, linguistic background, legal status, or other distinctive class based features. 
>
>It must also be noted that activities of targeting victims via profiling is the more nuanced issue that can be easily hidden by wrongdoers, by using proxy agents and sophisticated computation based technologies, for perpetrating their bad deeds.

Of course, *frontier-logic* states that if someone has been able to get away with silting your throat and snatching your resources, then your throat and your resources had belonged to them in the first place. But, dear Canada, as you can see, your agents and their parent agencies haven't managed to get away with their dastardly deeds, and their fiendishly insidious activities, as long as there is even a single being in this entire universe, that is able to recognize their acts of treachery and their crimes against humanity.
