## 2.4.1.3 Accrediting Agencies and Institutions of Canada

1. **Universities Canada:** The offices of the Governor General of Canada (the British Viceroy in Canada), as well as the offices of their deputies, have been the main influential entities responsible for the values inculcated in educational and fiduciary institutions of Canada. Whether it be colleges concerned with arts, sciences, humanities, engineering, business, medicine, law, religious studies, and any other vocational or theoretical topics in education, the standards as well as formal methodologies for imparting knowledge in those fields is created, and propagated by individuals posted to higher government offices of the country. The origin myths, the folktales, and legends that give some type of a shared sense of history towards social cohesion, to citizens and residents of the country, have to be constantly retold and amplified by somebody. That somebody along with their government offices and deputies, is a person who indoctrinates inter-generational culture carriers, and integrates hard-coded institutional polices to keep all territorial denizens in-line with the expectations, goals, interests, and long-term visions of persons in seats of socio-economic and political authority. So, the blame and culpability, for propagating unscrupulous and surreptitious designs that have continued to produce genocidal effects, and for giving directives, resources, as well as permissions to subordinates for carrying out harmful deeds, rests squarely upon the shoulders of such supreme wrongdoers. 

<br>

1. **College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO):** Can you imagine that for decades, tens of thousands of individuals who have been a part of your organization, have never questioned why psychiatry isn't a category of internal medicine? The appendices in *The File,* are mainly to highlight your systemic faults and errors. All theoretical and empirical models concerning communicable as well as non-communicable diseases, require a definition of biological vectors that negatively impact anatomy and physiology of human beings. Such models also, necessarily, indicate a prognosis of a care-recipient's medical condition. However, the act of pathologizing any of the cultural practices or political expressions of a person, has never required any mention of biological terms within existing diagnostic manuals of psychiatry, when attributing the labels of disordered, pathological, dysfunctional, or diseased to those outwardly expressions of a targeted person. So, every member of CPSO might as well meditate on answering the following question, on a daily basis, before performing any professional activities of the day: 

    >"How are physicians, surgeons, and medical technicians to prove to themselves, and to their care-recipients, that as professionals working in a critical environment, they do not have sociopathy due to an inability to be empathetic, or have a savior or a hero complex, in the form of a 'hidden or a latent' pathological dysfunction; or as a yet to be 'diagnosed' psychiatric disease?" 

<br>

1. **College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO):** I only have pity for the ways in which you have been handicapped and continuously prevented form being able to do your jobs correctly, and effectively, by provincial and federal agencies that need to pander to private insurance companies in North America. I don't have much else to say to you, other than implore all nurses to keep fighting as a unionized entity, for your individual and collective rights to a safe and dignified work place, and for being provided with proper amenities and remunerations; because it was only a nurse who had alerted me, each time I was being subjected to a medical malpractice by a doctor or by other nurses, within various medical facilities of Ontario's healthcare system. Most of you still genuinely care about people brought into a medical facility, including Canada's political prisoners. So you might as well, create a better standard for how that care is provided in professional settings by you and your peers.  

<br>

1. **Ontario College of Pharmacists (OCP):** Most probably Canada's healthcare industry would have already disintegrated, and many more people would continue to be subjected to medical malpractices if a pharmacist wasn't available to raise a question, about prescriptions doled out by improperly trained doctors. There has never been a strictly book-smart pharmacist who wasn't otherwise a people-and-customer-oriented professional at the pharmacy. This is because surviving in a high-stress environment with critical data and systems that impact large masses of people, each day, requires human beings who are more in-tune with the human condition, and for surviving within the workplace as a constantly beckoned pharmacist for trivial as well as complex issues of customers. Quite a few mathematicians, theoretical physicists, computer scientists, pilots, machinists, super-specialized surgeons, and medical technicians can get away with not being people-and-customer-oriented. However pharmacists, dentists, speech and physio therapists, gynecologists, ophthalmologists, sales-persons, and advocates aren't able to do so. 

<br>

1. **Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers:** Many of your workers have become experts in cleverly wielding the judiciary and its policing agencies, against innocent persons that those workers happen to be personally prejudiced against. I do not know how you will even begin to repair the extensive inter-generational harm you have continued to propagate, in the name of well-meaning social work. However, might I suggest that you start with taking an account of how much religious mythology is incorporated into your sense of morality, ethics, safety, security, and justice. You may also note whether you have correctly borrowed or adopted those precepts, from particular doctrines and cannons of certain religious texts. Then, compare all of that to the account of philosophies, frameworks, and practices involved in social work, from non-Euro-centric countries. Why? So that you may better understand why it is guaranteed that Canada will not be able to function as a nation-state, without immigrants and multi-cultural communities living freely and without subversive hindrances from government-sponsored agencies, within each of Canada's provinces, cities, neighborhoods, and institutions. It is going to be impossible to 'assimilate' people by forcing them into a patchwork quilt, or a melting pot, or a smelting crucible, while white-washing history to create a homogenized blob of humanity known as Canadians. What would even be the use of a homogenized country that lacks diversity, honesty, multi-multiculturalism, and a genuine respect for all the people murdered in Canada's genocides? The persons most in need of support, education and training towards non-deceptive, safer social behaviors, happen to be the old-school culture carriers of the state, embedded within the offices of provincial and federal governments, as well as in the larger private corporations and organizations operating in Canada. 

<br>

1. **Law Society of Ontario (LSO):** Do you have members with the courage and legitimate authority, to prosecute your previous and current, Director Generals and their deputies, as well as injurious judges and state-sponsored agents who have propagated dastardly practices from their seats of control and power? Why would any person bother to have any respect for your organization or your profession, or have anything other than a sense of loathsome contempt and disgust, against your leaders, if you don't have that type of courage and provable legitimacy, by way of your timely actions? What you need to prove, and who you need to prove it to, isn't me. The only reason my family and I were harmed in insidious ways by Canadian agencies, was because they have habitually continued to target people like us. It was only inevitable, that among those targeted groups and communities, Canada's public service units and secret agents would end up harming me, because of their prejudices, ill-will, xenophobia, and multiple forms of bigoted discrimination. The actions of Canada's government-sponsored agents, institutions, and of their private contractors, have caused me to move on, from being friendly, to being neutral to Canada and Canadians. You've had the opportunity for the past three years to change that, "for the better or for the worse", while knowingly or unknowingly impacting a range of identifiable, as well as non-identifiable entities. All you need to focus on, is the fact that your arguments and qualms aren't only with me. You also have to continuously prove your sense of ethics, morality, integrity, fairness and justice, to yourselves and to your Lord, against the following reality, demonstrated by a simple diagram:
