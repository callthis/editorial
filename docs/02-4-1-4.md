## 2.4.1.4 Misuse of Rationalism and Collateral Damage

>Supremacists regard any person who disagrees with them as an irrational creature. Continuing to disagree with supremacists after being labeled as irrational, causes one to be further dehumanized and then be labeled as, "an ungrateful, unpatriotic, arrogant, and violently deranged barbarian or terrorist, who is a danger to all free and august societies." Subsequent attempts by supremacists to subdue and suppress dissidents using force or guile, naturally generates a range of collateral damage and road-kill, but mainly as a result of unempathetic callus behaviors propagated by supreme wrongdoers. 

In this subsection, the main topic I'd like to discuss pertains to the risks posed to different communities because of a "rational" decision and judgment taken by an actor who possesses official powers and influence over vulnerable people; wherein such an authoritative actor evaluates various costs-and-benefits involved with a particular decision, on behalf of their ward, before enacting the decision as a 'final' judgment. We will first look at the ways in which the method of producing scientific justifications and legal discourse have become polluted, and co-opted, by colonial forces. We will then enter into a discussion on how a certain type of collateral damage can arise due to wrongful decision making, particularly in the context of commercial and industrial scale projects involving business management and engineering practices. Lastly, we will look at how seemingly good, well reasoned, apparently sound and scientific justifications as well as legal arguments, produced by imperialist and predatory capitalists for implementing their projects, cunningly hides or discounts grave risks posed by those projects to deliberately targeted communities and habitats. 

Let us now look at the misuse and abuse of rationalism by supreme wrongdoers. 

Strictly speaking, the concept of ratio or proportionality only has to do with algebraic or geometric entities that can be compared via mathematical axioms and theorems. In this mathematical sense of the word — ratio, only the scalar or vector result obtained by comparing two commensurate things via mathematical operations is said to be "objective." Moreover, the objectivity of a comparison between two mathematical objects is practically identical, each time the set of circumstances for producing those comparisons come into existence. 

For example, the length of a piece of string, compared to that of another distinct piece of string, by using a tape-measure, would indicate how much longer or shorter the first one is, in comparison to the second one, using suitable units of measure and a proper methodology for conducting the measurement. 

In the above example, the convention of adopting a particular unit of measure for length, say centimeters, and the methodology of using a properly calibrated measuring tape to identify the maximum straight-edge length of each piece of string, constitutes the circumstances that can yield an objective test for comparing the full lengths of two distinct pieces of strings. As such, each time these circumstances are repeated with the same, or any other comparable pieces of strings, the result obtained from the test would be called objective, along with a few caveats or notes about precision and accuracy with respect to: the material design of the tape-measure used, and the human as well as environmental factors associated with each set of measurements. 

From here onward, the simplistic example of comparing pieces of strings, or yarn, can be elaborated to write multiple textbooks on: legal metrology; applications of statistical tools and statistical analysis; as well as tomes on the philosophy of science, by introducing the concepts of "illusion" from human psychology (e.g. [Ponzo and  Müller-Lyer optical illusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_illusion)), and "speech community" from anthropology. 

However, we will instead have a closer look at how the misuse of rationalism and its abuse by fiduciary institutions results in collateral damage of inordinate proportions. 

### A Deep Dive Into The Rationality of Supremacists 

Even well-read and intellectually able persons often misuse the concept of rationality and rationalism, to indicate that only the forms of observable behaviors and knowledge palpable to their sensibility is rational, or sane, and all else is irrational or insane. Such persons who misuse the concept of rationality may eventually be forgiven, if they have never come across, or aren't familiar with the work of people like [Paul Feyerabend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend) on the topic of "scientific pluralism." However, the ones who are indoctrinated to abuse rationality and rationalism, particularly in judiciary, educational, and medical environs, cannot be forgiven so easily, and absolutely cannot be forgotten for enacting their deliberately forceful form of: injurious, destructive, and harmful misdeeds. 

The plurality of scientific frameworks, and likewise, the plurality of legal frameworks mainly comes from the largely independent development of scientific methodologies and vocabulary from different civilizations, that were practically isolated from each other at various points in time during human history. Over a period of thousands of years, the linguistic and cultural differences, particularly differences in religious worldviews of different nationalities, has become distinctly evident in the way different scientific and legal standards are followed by various geopolitical "blocs" of current, global geopolitical situation. For example, the space station operated by China is practically incompatible with machinery and equipment utilized by space missions from Europe and the US. From a commercial and industrial perspective, the divergence in fundamental standards for things like telecommunications and space technology, can also be attributed to intellectual property disputes and trade related protectionism adopted by each bloc. Such differences in standards adopted by professionals impact the daily lives of ordinary human beings across the globe because they also exist in the way things like railway networks and vaccines are manufactured as well as distributed to the masses. 

>*The power of commercial grade science and culture, can almost always surpass the might of military grade armaments.* 

More fundamentally, one needs to understand that any armament's production is due to existing science and scientists, its stockpiling is approved by existing cultural norms and culture carriers, and its use is permitted by members of mainstream society who willingly comply with existing cultural statutes. So, a geopolitical struggle or a competition to uphold the dominance of a particular scientific and cultural standard of living, naturally involves the day-to-day misuse and abuse of vocabulary that sounds 'scientific and objective.' The consequence of such misuse and abuse results in injuries and harms that most certainly contribute to the genocidal erasure of non-mainstream communities, which are regarded by supremacists as being 'waywardly', 'unworthy', or 'inferior.' This is why it is important to look more carefully at the ways in which science and its vocabulary are misused and abused by fascists, and by similar types of supremacist forces. 

The most typical misuse of mathematical theorems, and scientific laws, are for justifying and propagating the aesthetic values of a community that intends to become dominant, or remain dominant within a geopolitical arena, for the sake of asserting its 'preferences' over other communities. "Social Darwinism", and "Creative Destruction", are common forms of illegitimately framed rationales that seek to justify violence thrust upon minorities and targeted groups, by racist and supremacist forces. 

As another example, mathematically, it would be impossible to say that blond hair is less than, or greater than, or equivalent to brunet hair. The concept called "hair color" is not numerical nor ordinal, it is categorical, so its different types cannot be graded objectively using scientific vocabulary. However, such basic logic never stops supremacists from exercising their incorrigibly vile designs. 

"Blond-hair and blue-eyes are the epitome of beauty, and people who possess such features are therefore supreme!" Okay?

No, not okay, definitely not okay. Even if outwardly features of any being were supposed to be the ultimate form of beauty by some set of racist rationales, having those characteristics or traits would still not make a person supreme at anything, nor would it cause the person with any superficial traits to consequently have any form of 'supreme authority and powers.' Especially in the context of legal concerns and judgments, mere acts of alliteration to Westernized aesthetics within legal arguments, do not replace, nor surpass basic logical reasoning, or do they? 

The previous sentiment, by the way, is not a matter of opinion of only one individual, it needs to be tested repeatedly, as and when required for verification by every legitimate form of jurisprudence, in every modern country, for every recorded case-file. Of course, any set of tests about which civilization's rationales are worthy of adoption or not, eventually devolves into a military conflict. It can then be seen that till date, all the world wars that have come to pass, haven't managed to provide any worthwhile utility in promoting racist ideologies. But that hasn't stopped racist imperialists and colonialists from deploying supremacist designs of governance, using belligerent as well as clandestine mechanisms of repression, against minorities and dissidents. 

Moreover, it appears that historical records concerning thousands of years of armed conflict between various nations, and between various factions among human beings, has only provided one single verifiable conclusion:

>Any creature, no matter how big or small, has its own way of surviving, within its ecological context of unpredictable, dynamic, and evolving circumstances generated by nature. 

Perhaps one is to consider racism as a survival strategy, that allows a populist regime to keep its authoritative position and socio-economic powers, by snatching rights and resources from unassuming people, who can be put down using simplistic, and superficial excuses, especially "for making an empire or a country great again." History stands as witness that such populist designs have only brought about more bloodshed, due to violent public uprisings, in connection to sectarian divisions shored up by partisan regimes. However, all such observations have not, and most probably will not stop supremacists, nor will such observations even grant the tiniest measure of humility to any of them, so that they may immediately put an end to their machinations, which have already blighted most of the earth. 

So, for any of us to be able to defend our dignity, heritage, properties, livelihoods, and lives from being plundered or violated, by those who claim to be 'super-powers', we must rightly comprehend the ways in which abuses are committed against us, within every domain of interaction; and then put an end to those abuses, or at least, find or create the means to fend for ourselves against the spread of *idiocracy.* 

### Abuses of Educational Standards

As noted earlier, sets of explicitly and tacitly shared norms and socio-political values, which constitute the culture of a society, happen to be the basis for initializing the research and development (R&D) of all consequential commercial and industrial things desired by members of that society, including armaments. 

Educational standards are at the very core of personal growth, learning and development for each individual who then contributes embodied values to their community, as well as an integral member of socio-economic and geopolitical functions performed by their country. So, what form of values can a person be expected to embody, and consequentially contribute to the international community as a global citizen, when the use of dishonesty, duplicity, guile, and deception for promoting selfish interests derived from personal greed, are the main as well as overarching principles, that guide the person? 

Gathering lackeys and sycophants who go along with profiteering motives of a cult leader, for cleverly boosting a personal agenda of that leader as a public good, is the only logical and factually evident consequence of adopting the rationalizations of predatory capitalism and imperialism.   

"Greed is good", "lean in", "fake-it-till-you-make-it", and other such maxims doled out as catch phrases and buzz words by predatory pundits, only cause decay and erosion of proper educational standards that are meant to be upheld by publicly funded educational institutions.  

> Particularly, when the vice-chancellors of universities use colleges and schools as their private tuck shops for peddling [tchotchkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tchotchke) and trinkets, in the form of made-up certificate programs and superficial degrees, the only eventual outcome is the gangrenous decay of economic standards of a country, and the demise of the country's skilled labor forces. This in turn, spurs the next generation of con-artists who perpetrate scams at even larger scales of reach and magnitude across the globe, via seemingly reputable and legitimate organizations. 

Particularly when fields of medicine, psychology, sociology, linguistics, and political sciences inculcate designs and precepts of colonialism within the curriculum taught to successive generations of unsuspecting youth, the only outcome is the veneration and propagation of Euro-centric colonial themes and emblems, which have continued to defile the basic human rights of indigenous cultures. Colonial and imperial emblems have only served to instill a sense of plunderous and ravenous greed, among all those who have publicly or privately adopted those emblems, as a representation of norms that constitute the foundations of global human society, and as the representation of a vision for humanity's future. Those colonial themes and emblems have also continued to desecrate the inalienable heritage, and equity, present within natural microcosms of Earth, that have belonged to native peoples. 

Using corrupted educational standards, the easiest way to con new entrants into a school, or a community, is to constantly plug the emblems of *trinity* and *trifecta* into the eyes and ears of the new learners. For example, the idea of mind-body-soul as a tripartite model of human beings is a cunning design to misdirect people's attention, away from vital precepts such as mind-body-soul-**home.** Such ideals like mind-body-soul-home used to be, and in some cases are still portrayed within, remaining indigenous artworks and symbolism. However, by making sure that the concept of "home" is removed from the focal point of the person being indoctrinated or mesmerized by a corrupted school, the equity of that person, which resides within the person's home and native habitat, can be easily stolen by fascists and predatory capitalists. 

Thus, a person who never realizes that their home-equity got stolen, or a person who realizes it too late, obviously cannot do anything else but sullenly submit and eventually succumb to the forces of ruinous malice, which managed to rob the basic equity necessary to house a so-called mind-body-and-soul. 

Naturally, within a fascist regime, anybody who is too vocal or publicly dissenting of being conned by the beguiling or bullying forces utilized by corrupt officials, is pathologized and labeled as a mad person, by the authoritative colleges of psychology and psychiatry, which are brandished by the regime's culture carriers for political purposes. 

Even to this day, the concept of "psychiatric disease" in Western schools and colleges of psychiatry, does not bother to prioritize and properly explain biological vectors, pharmaco-genetics, and physical causal factors for sets of 'symptoms' that are given the label of mental disorders. And yet, those Western schools of psychiatry promulgate dangerous pharmacological interventions with a narrow therapeutic bandwidth, which invariably produce neuro-endocrine harms and other visceral injuries to vulnerable people including pregnant women and children. Practitioners graduating from such schools of psychiatry with flawed educational standards, are too often taught to use biochemical, surgical, and electromechanical tools for altering the physiology of a patient in clinical settings, without the patient's proper consent and agreement. However, the manuals for psychiatric diagnoses with recommended pharmaceutical prescriptions used in such schools and clinics, do not mention any biochemical, physiological, or electromechanical models of human physiology that need to be addressed for betterment of the patient's health. Instead, tortuous techniques involving sociological, verbal, biochemical, surgical, and electromechanical techniques are used — strictly for the purposes of 'tuning' a person's thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, and personality traits towards socially and politically submissive behavior, in the name of 'therapy.' 

Therefore, one might as well go to any arbitrary witch-doctor to find curative methods for ailments, by having the so-called doctor read scattered pieces of bones and sea shells tossed onto the floor, which has no basis in human physiological sciences, instead of waiting for months or years to be seen by a licensed medical practitioner in places like Ontario, Canada. 

Illegitimate medical diagnostics, delayed or ineffective treatments, and punitive medicine used against targeted groups of people, have continued to be the go-to tactics of harassment as well as surreptitious tools of repression, deployed by cunning state-sponsored agents who are in-charge of furthering the state's 'nationalist and patriotic agenda.' 

As such, even the equity that a person has within their own body and cognitive faculties is eventually stolen or despoiled by industrialized forces that consider minorities, immigrants, and refugees as chattel. 

### Bystanders in Educational Institutes and Campuses 

*Open Letters in the Tabloid Section* of [this repository](https://github.com/callthis/), provides examples of Canadian agents and actors, who have continued to willingly play an integral and culpable role within systematized activities of the state's organizations, directed towards unethical and even genocidal designs against targeted groups of people. Those examples are provided within the more specific context of *The File.* As such, all materials within this repository have been made available to be placed on the record, by virtue of being published to this publicly viewable, online, multi-media outlet. 

I'd now like to draw your attention towards the bystanders within state-sponsored and state-regulated organizations, who would not have wanted to directly participate as leaders or culture carriers within the colonial designs of their fathers and forefathers. The suffering felt by those bystanders who tend to become collateral damage, usually goes unnoticed, or unmentioned because: those persons are not the direct victims of a state's deplorable activities; nor are they the typical, enthusiastic participants within harmful activities targeting profiled individuals and minorities. Many of those bystanders might even know that being silent or complacent beneficiaries, of an institution and its organizational culture which robs innocent victims of vital energies, equity, and material resources, is a form of compliance with the systemic mechanisms of the deleterious institutions they are beholden to. It is even possible that in understanding their own complicit behavior in the form of silence, and in the form of their complicit acceptance of benefits enjoyed in the form of ill-gotten gains obtained via unethical exploitation of snared or stranded victims, those bystanders comprehend their guilty actions as indirect participants of the overall exploitative apparatus. But many of them tamp down on their guilt and shame, and continue to pretend that it is somebody else's job to rectify the foundational faults of the systems they've inherited. 

Examples of those bystanders are [The Greenhouse in UWaterloo](https://github.com/callthis/tabloid/blob/main/docs/04-00.md#4-segregationism), and ["Not Prince Harry."](https://github.com/callthis/tabloid/blob/main/docs/05-10.md#510-not-to-harry)

The topics discussed in this section, are specifically in the context of conniving bad behaviors, covert hostilities, and dastardly offenses being perpetrated by members of institutions like IRCC, UWaterloo-MBET, GRHC, LHC, CMHA, WRPS, LSO, CPSO, Health Canada, and Universities Canada. 

It needs to be mentioned here that, faculty of UWaterloo-MBET have continued to teach the idea of apologizing later to injured persons in a facetious and disingenuous manner, only if caught; and to never ask consent or permission from unsuspecting customers and investors, before doing any kind of gray-area activities while using 'frontier-logic.' Furthermore, one of the greatest offenses of UWaterloo has been in continuing to supply tools and approbations to proxy agents, for carrying out clandestine genocidal activities throughout Ontario. Its other grave offenses have been in continuing to rip off local and international students while pretending to possess "the golden standard", that determines what counts as authentic educational training and coursework for "entrepreneurship."
