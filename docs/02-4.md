## 2.4 Category IV — Supreme Wrongdoers

The most egregious category of offenders and abusive criminals are the highly celebrated, and popular authority figures who provide approbations and designs for committing industrially organized crimes. Their approbations and designs have only continued to spread discriminatory prejudices, inculcated within social norms and legalized practices of pan-continental societies that venerate them. Such authority figures propagate supremacist and racist ideologies, through the societies they govern and control. Often, controlling actions of such leaders are implemented in a directed manner, via institutionalized socio-economic and political mechanisms, for the purposes of: subversion, theft of equity, mass abductions, serial rapes, mass killings, ethnic cleansing, eugenics, religious conversions, suppression, oppression, terrorism, cyber-attacks, committing inter-generational harms, and for conducting other genocidal activities against marginalized groups as well as targeted individuals. Such leaders and 'charismatic authority figures' are lauded by the culture carriers of their society, and are boosted as a 'higher power' with indisputable authority to pass final judgments concerning societal and environmental issues. 

This category of professionals in leadership positions are acutely aware and knowledgeable of the illegitimate nature of their deeds. They are also aware of the far reaching societal ramifications of their culpable actions. And yet, they ardently remain dedicated to propagating harms against targeted groups or dissenting individuals, using every dastardly means possible. These are the individuals who knowingly, willingly, and forcibly — dictate, instigate, approve, preside over, facilitate, as well as personally finance, the activities of their hardened followers to spread a reign of fear, terror, racism, and hate. 

An easy way to identify them, is by the fact that they happen to have the word "Supreme", in one or the other title that they end up acquiring. 

These supreme wrongdoers are not the fringe elements of human society like middle-aged goons who go around calling themselves, "Proud Boys." They are the main architects and legendary fiends who have left an indelible mark on global humanity, as its predatory overlords, such as: Charles Cornwallis, Herbert Kitchener, Adolf Hitler, Franz Pfeffer, and Donald E. Cameron. 

Perhaps Donald Cameron is not known as a predator, from the perspective of most people who might have worked with him, or from the perspective of those who might have read about him and his 'ground breaking' work. Donald Cameron, might not even be that popular among lay persons, for having created any kind of a mark on the global-scale of human ecology. There were indeed, particular supremacists and racists at the end of World War II, who managed to adopt a more clever approach to spreading their ideologies. Donald Cameron was one of them. Also, around the end of World War II, most viceroys and governor generals of the dwindling British Empire, had realized that they needed to adopt a more subtle form of 'Anglican Supremacy', through partisanship, parasitism, and sabotage; rather than ostentatious displays of predation, and overtly hostile violence. 

>How can groups of victims ever manage to retaliate or develop any form of resistance, if they never manage to figure out that they've been attacked and enslaved? 
>
>Or, how would serfs and slaves ever manage to revolt, if targeted groups simply never become educated enough, particularly about the ways in which they are being attacked and subdued, or handicapped, and then, readily subverted?  

Please glance through Section 2.1.2., to see an example of indoctrinated workers, who have continued to propagate the wrongful policies and practices of their venerated "forefathers." Donald Cameron was one such, "Father of Psychiatry and Psychology" who embedded his racist views within institutionalized practices of entities like the National Institute of Health, UK, and the National Institute of Mental Health, USA. His racist ideologies about what a Super-Human is and ought to be, have ordained the process by which "able" persons ought to serve, or try to become, an "Übermensch." According to his published and publicly espoused views, everyone else who is considered "disabled", ought to be fixed, sterilized, or neutralized, for the betterment of the global human species. As such, for promoting his views on eliminating, or reprogramming 'undesirable and mentally unfit people', he oversaw the [MK-Ultra Program, at the Allen Memorial Institute of McGill University, Montreal, Ontario, Canada.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKUltra#Experiments_on_Canadians) 

Through his illegal and inhumane experiments conducted on abducted, involuntary, captive persons brought to the MK-Ultra Program, he sought to develop electro-mechanical and biochemical techniques for "denaturing" a human being, so that the captive person who was turned into a "blank slate", could then be groomed and re-educated into a person with a target set of personality traits, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. The person programmed through a variety of tortuous techniques, was also meant to precisely act upon given cues or triggers, to fulfill premeditated plans embedded within the person's memory via "psychic driving." Psychic driving was a torture technique invented and promoted by Donald Cameron, as a 'therapeutic technique' for rectifying: "'the mentally disturbed' and 'culturally inappropriate behaviors' of rude or uncooperative individuals." 

Any kind of behaviors that could be construed as rude or uncooperative, which were contrary to the liking of state-sponsored agencies with Euro-Centric worldviews, were seen as 'unhygienic', and were thus ordered to be 'sanitized.' Consequently, the very definition of "insanity" in medical sciences, has continued to incorporate the political, racist, and cruel ideologies of old-school Nazis, and of Nordic, Italian, Francophone, Greek, as well as Anglo-Saxon supremacists. 

The MK-Ultra Program was also conducted with aims of developing covert techniques, for "information extraction", from captured persons. 

None of the techniques developed by Donald Cameron were therapeutic, they were only methods for damaging the neuro-endocrine system of a targeted person in ways that wouldn't leave outwardly marks of torture, while harming the cognitive faculties and reproductive organs of the victim. The injuries and harms disguised as therapy, were to be repeatedly and systematically inflicted upon the captured persons in such a manner, that the handicapped and wounded individuals wouldn't be able to cogently and coherently articulate, the horrifyingly violent things done to them. Those strategies and techniques of doing visceral harms to targeted and marginalized people, in the guise of administering 'medical therapy' to 'diseased' individuals with psycho-social 'disorders and pathology', has become normalized as 'state-of-the-art medicine', practiced within Euro-Centric cultures. 

As a result of Donald Cameron's influence over professionals in psychology and psychiatry, even to this day, to any external observer, a captive human subject who has been harmed because of vile experiments conducted upon them, only appears as a stymied and mentally handicapped person (a 'certifiably' mentally handicapped person), whose word or testimony cannot be taken seriously or believed in, for any practical purposes. Moreover, 'the poor patient' is viewed as, being taken care of by a 'generous' healthcare system; within the much more trustworthy hands of the 'most qualified', 'highly renowned', and 'most competent' professionals working in the fields of "modern medicine, mental health, and rehabilitation."  

In propagating his ideologies, the most profound and diabolical activities conducted by Donald Cameron were for instilling a sense of awe, among his underlings and peers. Those underlings and peers have continued to adorn and worship him, as a father-like authority figure. That is why: textbooks, coursework, policies, methodologies, practices, and tools fashioned in the healthcare industry for mental health diagnostics and prescribed therapies, especially in Canada, have continued to reference the work of Donald Cameron, without ever mentioning anything related to the physiological factors that could possibly impact neuro-endocrine systems of a person. The kinds of "symptoms" and "behavioral appearances" of a person, that would qualify the individual for a diagnosis of mental health challenges, have continued to be taught in universities throughout Western Europe and North America, on the basis of criteria innovated and propagated by Donald Cameron and his camp of posies. Donald Cameron engineered those racist and physiologically inaccurate criteria for mental health diagnoses, with the help of his posies in the World Psychiatric Association, American Psychiatric Association, and Canadian Psychiatric Association during the 1950s and 1960s. 

Universities in France, Germany, Switzerland, UK, US, Australia, and Canada have continued to indoctrinate successive generations of professionals in psychiatry, general practitioners in medicine, as well as healthcare workers focusing on socio-economic and psychological factors, with sets of racist tools and techniques developed in the early and mid-1900s, derived from the 'seminal work' of Donald Cameron. Western universities and colleges, have continued to disregard the more accurate physiological sciences concerning pharmacology, anatomical functions of neuro-endocrine organs, and gene expression, all of which have indicators of biological health measurable with computational techniques, for other categories of internal medicine except psychiatry, since the nineteen seventies. Psychiatry has remained the only field of medical science that is not categorized as "internal medicine" by the healthcare and insurance industries, even though the electromechanical, as well as neuroleptic and psychotropic drug based interventions, prescribed by psychiatric doctors, happen to impact the entire systemic biological functions of a person's body, via mechanisms strictly internal to the person's anatomy and physiology. 

>What use is a physician or a medical doctor, who simply cannot comprehend or explain physiological factors that produce apparent symptoms of a documented medical condition? 
>
>Medical practitioners who do not prioritize accurate diagnostic tests for physiological ailments, obviously, need not be given a medical license to prescribe dangerous medications and procedures. And yet, all of psychiatry has continued to rely on "trial-and-error" based methods of prescribing invasive procedures and narcotic drugs, to persons seeking medical therapy for their physiological ailments; ailments that might have even occurred due to environmental poisoning rather than any psycho-sociological 'disorders.' However, because many physiological ailments happen to coincide with behavioral or cognitive challenges, but without haemodynamic instability, they are regarded as pertaining to "the mental", as opposed to "the physical" situation of the patient. 
>
>Additionally, while considering the entire history of global humanity, till date, scientists and medical practitioners have not settled on the question of what constitutes "the mind", and whether any phenomena categorized as psychological, is due to a thing that is separate from physical matter as well as physical energies. While skirting such foundational concerns, medical practitioners have continued to utilize false narratives and racist views on what constitutes and leads to, cognitive functions of a human being, while prescribing highly invasive and dangerous physical interventions, in the name of psychiatric or psychological 'therapy.' 

The range of inter-generational and global-scale harms, being carried out by the indoctrinated followers of persons like Donald Cameron, have only been possible because of the eager willingness of instructors and managers of collegiate programs, as well as of the certifying authorities of those training programs, to promote and propagate the nefarious designs put forth by their 'esteemed' leaders. For instance, the activities being carried out by those case-hardened followers, in diminishing and downplaying the importance of neuro-endocrine health and reproductive rights of working-class people, has become culturally embedded within the functions of institutions like Health Canada, and within the curriculum of programs taught in Canadian universities and colleges. 

Witting and unwitting followers of persons like Donald Cameron, have continued to promote racist designs and ideologies, at the expense of ordinary tax-payers, and in violation of ethical standards for protecting vulnerable people, in order to pursue their dream of creating a nation that reigns supreme over all realms, as a global "Super-Power." They have continued to do so, while forcefully exercising their ignorance and ill-informed zeal, for 'rectifying' behavioral and cultural 'aberrations', exhibited by any person who may come into their line of sight. The types of behaviors of a person that may be seen as culturally unacceptable by medical and other authoritative professionals, which can then be officially labeled by those professionals as 'immoral, bizarre, or queer', happen to be from the perspective of state-sponsored institutions and agencies, that have never cared for legitimate physiological sciences. Those types of institutions and agencies have also, never cared for cultural pluralities that have necessarily existed among various peoples, and human civilizations of Earth. The priorities of licensed medical practitioners, accreditation bodies, and collegiate level educators have continued to be shaped by the priorities of "Supreme Leaders" and states-persons, who possibly could not and cannot care, about the rights and necessities of all other human beings, whom they only view as their god-given chattel. 

Those very same followers, have also continued to venerate the racist deeds and supremacist ideologies of "Supreme Commanders" like British Monarchs, Charles Cornwallis, Herbert Kitchener, Adolf Hitler, Franz Pfeffer, Dwight Eisenhower, Donald Rumsfeld, and Donald Trump. 

I must necessarily include all British Monarchs in the above-mentioned list of supreme racists, because: 

>"Has any person ever come across a British Monarch, who wasn't utterly fearful of, or apathetic towards the idea that, multi-cultural diversity and non-Christian scientific worldviews, arising from multi-modal nature of global geopolitics, can naturally take the lead in guiding humankind, to an ecologically healthy, sustainable, equitable, and progressive future?"
