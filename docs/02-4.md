## 2.4 Category IV — Supreme Wrongdoers

The most egregious category of offenders and abusive criminals are the highly celebrated, and popular authority figures of industrially organized crimes, which involve widespread discriminatory prejudices inculcated within social norms and legalized practices of a society. Such authority figures propagate supremacist and racist ideologies, through the societies they govern and control. Often, controlling actions of such leaders are implemented in a directed manner, via institutionalized socio-economic and political mechanisms, for the purposes of: subversion, theft of equity, mass abductions, serial rapes, mass killings, ethnic cleansing, eugenics, inter-generational harms, religious conversions, suppression, oppression, terrorism, cyber-attacks, and for conducting other genocidal activities against marginalized groups as well as targeted individuals. Such leaders and 'charismatic authority figures' are lauded by the culture carriers of their society, and are boosted as a 'higher power' with indisputable authority to pass final judgments concerning societal and environmental issues. 

This category of professionals in leadership positions are acutely aware and knowledgeable of the illegitimate nature of their deeds. They are also aware of the far reaching societal ramifications of their culpable actions. And yet, they ardently remain dedicated to propagating harms against targeted groups or dissenting individuals, using every dastardly means possible. These are the individuals who knowingly, willingly, and forcibly — dictate, instigate, approve, preside over, facilitate, as well as personally finance, the activities of their hardened followers to spread a reign of fear, terror, racism, and hate. 

An easy way to identify them, is by the fact that they happen to have the word "Supreme", in one or the other title that they end up acquiring. 

These supreme wrongdoers are not the fringe elements of human society like middle-aged goons who go around calling themselves, "Proud Boys." They are the main architects and legendary fiends who have left an indelible mark on global humanity, as its predatory overlords, such as: Charles Cornwallis, Herbert Kitchener, Adolf Hitler, Franz Pfeffer, and Donald E. Cameron. 

Perhaps Donald Cameron is not known as a predator, from the perspective of most people who might have worked with him, or from the perspective of those who might have read about him and his 'ground breaking' work. Donald Cameron, might not even be that popular, in terms of creating any kind of a mark on the global scale of human ecology. Indeed, there were particular supremacists and racists at the end of World War II, who managed to adopt a more clever approach to spreading their ideologies. Donald Cameron was one of them. Also, around the end of World War II, most viceroys and governor generals of the dwindling British Empire, had realized that they needed to adopt a more subtle form of 'Anglican Supremacy', through partisanship, parasitism, and sabotage; rather than ostentatious displays of predation, and overtly hostile violence. 

>How can groups of victims ever manage to retaliate or develop any form of resistance, if they never manage to figure out that they've been attacked and enslaved?

>Or, how would serfs and slaves ever manage to revolt, if targeted groups simply never become educated enough, particularly about the ways in which they are being attacked and subdued, or handicapped, and then, readily subverted?
