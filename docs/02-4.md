## 2.4 Category IV — Supreme Wrongdoers

The most egregious category of offenders and abusive criminals are the highly celebrated and popular authority figures of organized crimes, involving widespread discriminatory prejudices inculcated within social norms and legalized practices of a society, which those figureheads happen to propagate. Often, controlling actions of such leaders are <i>directedly</i> implemented via standardized mechanisms, for the purposes of marginalization, subversion, theft of equity, eugenics, mass abductions, serial rapes, mass killings, ethnic cleansing, religious conversions, oppression, cyber-attacks, and genocides. Such leaders and 'charismatic authority figures' are lauded by the culture carriers of their society, and are boosted as a 'higher power' with indisputable authority to pass final judgments concerning societal and environmental issues. This category of professionals in leadership positions are acutely aware and knowledgeable of the illegitimate nature of their deeds. They are also aware of the far reaching societal ramifications of their culpable actions. And yet, they ardently remain dedicated to propagating harms against targeted groups or dissenting individuals, using every dastardly means possible. These are the individuals who knowingly, willingly, and forcibly — dictate, instigate, approve, preside over, facilitate, as well as personally finance, the activities of their hardened followers to spread a reign of fear, terror, or hate.
