## 2. Categories of Wrongdoers Who Contribute to High Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity

In Canada, the following categories of wrongdoers and threat-actors have been observed and duly noted, whose actions continue to contribute to the suffering and demise of surreptitiously targeted communities; targeted communities that mainly comprise of differently abled people, ethnic minorities, and newcomers.

The case in point here, happens to include the offices of the Justice of Peace, in Ontario, along with institutions in Kitchener-Waterloo region such as University of Waterloo (UWaterloo), Grand River Hospitals and Clinics (GRHC), Waterloo Regional Police Services (WRPS), Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA), community healthcare providers like Carizon, and accreditation bodies affiliated with the provincial government of Ontario as well as the federal government of Canada. 

It has been particularly disheartening to witness the incompetence of some, along with the woeful hypocrisy of many other Canadian organizations, with regards to human rights violations committed by their authorized members. This has been especially due to politically motivated abuses of medical and psychological sciences committed against targeted minority groups in Ontario, Canada. Each of such offending and problematic organizations have private benefactors, apart from federal as well as provincial support that protects them from prosecution. The bad organizations in Canada that produce injuries and harms, to selectively targeted groups and individuals while portraying themselves to be the global vanguards of justice, peace, and human rights aren't merely a few in number, nor do they happen to be edge cases among a majority of good ones. The number of good organizations remaining in Canada have steadily dwindled over the years during the past few decades. The societal culture of adopting silence to allow large-scale human rights violations against minorities, and consumer rights abuses against large sections of the public, to go unchecked and continue unabated, has snowballed in strength across Canada.
